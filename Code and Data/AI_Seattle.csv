Want to disrupt an industry by delighting customers? Looking for a job where your work can have direct and massive impact? Excited to join one of the newest and most exciting AWS services? Come be a leader on a team that is building a product that will touch millions of people daily.

Amazon Connect is a highly disruptive cloud-based contact center that enables businesses to deliver engaging, dynamic, and personal customer service experiences. Amazon Connect is the result of the ten years of development that went into building the tools Amazon uses to provide its award winning customer service at massive scale and launching it as a publicly available AWS service. With Amazon Connect, you can create your own cloud-based contact center and be taking calls in minutes. With Amazon Connect you can leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence and the large ecosystem of AWS services such as Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3 and Amazon Kinesis to provide a truly frustration free, easy-to-use, and natural customer experience. With this technology, we are transforming an industry and the way customers interact with businesses and how agents service them.

Industry analysts have said, “Amazon Connect is quietly positioned to massively disrupt by enabling companies to focus on customer service, not service centers.” and “Amazon is totally disrupting the customer contact center space as they have many other market-spaces with customer-centric solutions with open platform integration with assistance from the partner community.”

We are seeking a Senior Systems Development Engineer to join our Seattle team to innovate on the telecom infrastructure that is fundamental to modern contact centers in the cloud.

“We’re not in the shipping business; we’re in the information business” -Peter Rose, Expeditors Founder
As a Fortune 500 company, Expeditors employs more than 15,000 trained professionals in a worldwide network of over 300 locations across six continents. Expeditors satisfies the increasingly sophisticated needs of international trade through customized solutions and seamless, integrated information systems. Our services include the consolidation and forwarding of air or ocean freight, customs brokerage, vendor consolidation, cargo insurance, time-definite transportation, order management, warehousing, distribution and customized logistics solutions.

Job Description
Digital Twin technology for the supply chain has been receiving a lot of buzz lately; and for good reason. Imagine if you were a business owner with your supply chain digitally rendered and laid out before you. Imagine being able to change anything you want: suppliers, inventory positions, scale up or down demand, evaluate disruption scenarios. Imagine being able to apply advanced simulation, optimization, statistical analysis, AI, and ML to the supply chain, to support better, faster decision making. That is the future of supply chain management. A future enabled by digital twin technology.
Join the Supply Chain Solutions’ Living Model team as we build a bridge to that better tomorrow; providing customers with digital twin technology as a service, helping them fully understand and ultimately transform their supply chains with confidence – to improve, innovate, and be better prepared for disruption in an increasingly uncertain world.
The Expeditors Supply Chain Solutions group engages with customers in a variety of supply chain improvement projects, including supply chain network design, transport flow strategy development, inventory analysis, etc. Supply Chain Solutions is a rich learning environment that will provide considerable intellectual stimulation, while constantly testing your creativity. You’ll be working in an environment that’s highly collaborative, both internally and with clients.
While our projects are very diverse in terms of scope, industry, and objective, this position is specific to the Living Model Service, a subscription-based offering featuring the Living Model, a persistent modeling environment that is used to create a ‘digital twin’ of the logistics network that underlies the supply chain.
The service is offered in tiers, the first tier is our ‘Essentials’ product, which provides strategic and tactical dashboard visuals of the customer’s supply chain, regardless of service provider. The model is enabled by a steady stream of supply chain data that keeps the model synchronized with the physical supply chain – a key component of digital twin technology. While providing value as a single comprehensive view of the supply chain across all service providers that is constantly updated, it goes farther in that it sits on top of a digital twin of the supply chain – so customers can change what they see through ‘what if’ scenarios that impose change on the supply chain, illuminating tradeoffs in responsiveness, cost, carbon, etc.
Your job will be to sell, market, and develop the Living Model Service Essentials offering. You will also work with existing customers and our account management team to facilitate collaborative design sessions that will identify opportunities for improvement in their supply chain that can be quantified leveraging their data that is in the system and the advanced simulation and optimization capabilities of the platform. These studies are not covered by the Essentials subscription price and instead are sold as hourly consulting projects. Other tiers of the service include blocks of consulting hours that are included in the higher monthly subscription price. The Essentials service offers a customer the ability to ‘pay as they go’ while still enjoying the benefits of digital twin technology as a basis for supply chain research and development.
In addition, you will cultivate data dexterity and a keen attention to detail while working closely with engineers as they leverage sophisticated supply chain optimization and simulation software to test and either validate or refute the hypothesis that is the focus of supply chain studies you help to surface and design. It will be your responsibility to ensure that all drivers material to the study are identified and considered, that the results of the study are qualified, and that they are delivered in a comprehensive, concise, and substantively compelling way. Study objectives will be to incent internal and external stakeholders to implement the improvements the studies advocate if those studies predict beneficial outcomes. You will be the agent of change to drive clients’ supply chains to the next level of excellence. The Living Model is a cutting-edge technology and Expeditors is leading the industry by bringing it to market.
The Living Model is a cutting-edge technology and Expeditors is leading the industry by bringing it to market. This is an opportunity to be part of an exciting new offering.

3. Drive development of marketing materials to promote the Living Model Essentials Service and ancillary consulting projects based on the service.
4. Drive development of the dashboards that provide strategic visibility into the supply chain by working with engineers who will create the dynamic infographics that provide the content for the Living Model Essentials Analytics Suite.
5. Suggest, frame, and execute supply chain studies to drive continuous improvement and innovation.

5. Maintain oversight of all projects in progress so that you can identify potential schedule risks early and take preventative action.
6. Maintain close collaboration with the Living Model development team; ensuring that project engineers use the functionality already developed. If there is a gap in functionality needed to execute customer projects, articulate the requirements clearly, so that the Research and Development team can develop the functionality for future projects.
7. Perform post-project evaluations with the engineer to identify accomplishments and lessons learned. Identify best practices and share it with the larger engineering and SCS team.
8. Maintain knowledge of engineer skills, and potential skill deficits, and develop training/education plans to improve the skill or eliminate the deficit.
9. Guide/coach engineers in future career aspirations, and assist them in pursuing new opportunities.
10. Conduct performance evaluations of engineers.

Semantic Scholar (semanticscholar.org) is a free, AI-powered research tool for scientific literature. We have grown from a groundbreaking research project at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence to a product millions of scholars use every week.

Job Description
Digital Twin technology for the supply chain has been receiving a lot of buzz lately and for good reason. Imagine if you were a business owner with your supply chain digitally rendered and laid out before you. Imagine being able to change anything you want: suppliers, inventory positions, scale up or down demand, evaluate disruption scenarios. Imagine being able to apply advanced simulation, optimization, statistical analysis, AI, and ML to the supply chain, to support better, faster decision making. That is the future of supply chain management. A future enabled by digital twin technology.
Join the Supply Chain Solutions’ Living Model team as we build a bridge to that better tomorrow; providing customers with digital twin technology as a service, helping them fully understand and ultimately transform their supply chains with confidence – to improve, innovate, and be better prepared for disruption in an increasingly uncertain world.
As the Supply Chain Project Technical Manager, you will oversee a team of bright and capable people, skilled in the field of analytics that work on supply chain projects arising from the customer’s subscription to the Living Model Service. You will be responsible for project operations, including project scoping and engineering capacity, and people management. You will also be a part of the engineering capacity, only to a supplemental extent, so that you may keep your analytics skills fresh and alleviate temporary capacity shortfalls. Although the Technical Manager oversees customer specific projects, the role must ensure that the projects use the data and software resident in the Living Model environment to the greatest extent possible.
Major Duties and Responsibilities:
1. Working with Living Model Program Managers, develop the detailed project scope that it is “engineering ready”, mapping data available in the Living Model environment to customer objectives, and developing assumptions or resetting the project expectations if the data can’t support the objectives.
2. Based on the projects in progress, projects in the pipeline, available engineering skill and capacity, you will assign the engineer to the project.
3. Guide the engineer so he/she knows how to proceed, and stays on task. During the project lifecycle, you will occasionally brainstorm with the engineer to develop solutions to complex problems.
4. Validate the deliverables of engineers, regardless of the mechanism (Power Point, visualization software, etc.) ensuring that they are of the highest quality (including accuracy, consistency and aesthetics) and the solutions make sense to a business audience.
5. Maintain oversight of all projects in progress so that you can identify potential schedule risks early and take preventative action.
6. Maintain close collaboration with the Living Model development team; ensuring that project engineers use the functionality already developed. If there is a gap in functionality needed to execute customer projects, articulate the requirements clearly, so that the Research and Development team can develop the functionality for future projects.
7. Perform post-project evaluations with the engineer to identify accomplishments and lessons learned. Identify best practices and share it with the larger engineering and SCS team.
8. Maintain knowledge of engineer skills, and potential skill deficits, and develop training/education plans to improve the skill or eliminate the deficit.
9. Guide/coach engineers in future career aspirations, and assist them in pursuing new opportunities.
10. Conduct performance evaluations of engineers.

Qualifications
Required Skills and Attributes:
1. Experience in managing people in a project context. In other words, a work stream with peaks, valleys, and potentially several projects in various stages or progress simultaneously, and a project pipeline with estimated scopes, start dates and durations.
2. Must be an effective listener and communicator, which can include difficult conversations at times. This is fundamentally a people management position, and these qualities are essential to effective leadership.
3. Must be willing and able to work with a remote team, in an environment where the following cultural elements are highly valued: Appearance, Attitude, Confidence, Curiosity, Excellence, Integrity, Pride, Resolute, Sense of Humor, and Visionary.
4. Demonstrate advanced skills in analytics, and associated tools and technologies.
5. Demonstrate a keen attention to detail: ensure that all aspects of a study are considered and that all outputs from the study ‘make sense’, correlate across the deliverable, and with consultant grade standards.
6. Must be willing and able to accept questioning and constructive criticism of work output.
Experience and Education:
Experience in managing a team of people required.

In April 2019, Fortive completed the acquisition of Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) from Johnson & Johnson for $2.7B.

The ASP & Censis acquisitions were a game-changer for Fortive in that the healthcare businesses became a growing share of overall revenue and the sector became fundamental to the go-forward strategy.

2 years working as a Data Scientist
Experienced in handling large data sets using SQL and databases in a business environment.

Job summary
A fulfillment center can appear to be a chaotic place. With millions of items moving in and out of an area twice as large as your average theme park every day, a quick peek under the roof would reveal a manic scene. You would see associates, machinery, vehicles, robots, and packages flying about at break-neck speeds and accessing a breathtaking number of shelves and bins that store products. In reality, however, this activity is all highly organized and orchestrated by software, with each movement carefully planned and optimized. However, there are times when mistakes occur: products may disappear, reappear in strange places, become damaged, or worse. When that happens, how does a fulfillment center operating at that size, speed, and scale recover gracefully and with minimal cost? How do we ensure that we meet our commitments to our customers and merchants? How do we find a needle in a haystack when we’re constantly shuffling the haystack around? And how do we do it at extreme scale in an environment of constant growth?

The Fulfillment AI team operates at a nexus of machine learning, computer vision, statistics, optimization, and healthy measure of hard-earned expertise in operations to build automated, algorithmic approaches to solving these problems at minimal cost. We create cutting edge software, building automated processes and workflows in the most complex operational problem space in the business world. So what should you expect from this role?

Major responsibilities: As a Data Scientist you will be working in one of the world's largest and most complex data analytics environments. You should have deep expertise in analyzing huge data sets from multiple domains. You should be expert at designing and implementing solutions that use a range of data science methodologies to automate data analysis or to solve complex business problems. You will design metrics for complex systems. You will deep dive ML training data and feature sets to drive improvements. You will partner with Research and Applied Scientists, SDEs, Technical Program Managers, Product Managers, and business leaders to identify solutions to large problems in Amazon Operations.

Your analysis and solution recommendations will drive system optimizations with global impact. You will develop metrics to quantify the benefits of a solution and influence project resources. You will audit metric data and use it to measure system impact and performance.

You will harness massive and diverse data sets to mine actionable insights for senior leaders. You will automate data feeds, validate the data input and analyze trends that lead to cost saving initiatives. In this role, you will own solving problems through deep data review, statistical analyses, and creation of analytic tools usable by others on the team. Your work products will guide our reporting, benchmarking, program optimization, financial planning, and execution strategy.

The ideal candidate is a motivated self-starter who can thrive in a fast-paced environment. They will enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team of engineers, scientists and business leaders. They will seek to understand processes behind data so their recommendations are grounded.

Flexibility
It isn’t about which hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We offer flexibility and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

The technology is multi-patented, AI-powered, industry-shaping customer data management software that we invented because there was no way to solve the problems that we wanted to help consumer brands overcome. The opportunity is twofold: a market opportunity to provide a solution that consumer brands have been trying to find for decades, and a personal opportunity to grow and learn and hitch your career to a rocket ship.

Since our founding in 2016, Amperity has been growing 2.5X year-over-year. We've raised $187M in funding, including a recent Series D that increased our valuation to over one billion dollars. We're going places, fast, and we want you to come with us.

We help these brands make sense of massive amounts of transaction and engagement data so that they can finally know who their customers are, what opportunities exist, and how to provide the kinds of experiences that delight consumers and move the business metrics that matter. Our customers include Starbucks, Alaska Airlines, Patagonia, Kroger, J. Crew, Brooks Running, Planet Fitness, DICK's Sporting Goods, and many more.

We're building something that's never existed before, and we're doing it in a way that's great for consumers, transformational for our customers, and career-making for the members of the Amperity team. Come help us make it happen!
The Team

The data science team at Amperity is a close-knit community of engineers and data scientists that move quickly and rely on each other to think independently, work autonomously, handle ambiguity, and solve hard problems. We identify, design and implement algorithms that lie at the heart of our products:

Identity matching: deduplicating and clustering billions of records to their underlying identities daily. Our customers use our predictions to analyze their customer base and create a personalized experience for their customers at every touchpoint.
Predictive modeling: With unified and enriched customer profiles (thanks to our identity matching pipeline), we build advanced customer-centric models to predict metrics/behaviors such as customer lifetime value, product recommendations, discount sensitivity, and event propensity.

In addition to algorithmic development, we value sharing our findings with the broader data science community. We publish our research in top-tier peer-reviewed publications, engage with fellow data scientists by speaking at internal and external conferences, and also hold several patents focused on our core IP (with many more to come).

We're looking for a Lead Machine Learning Engineer to join our rapidly growing data science team and help lead us in developing state-of-the-art machine learning pipelines. As a tech lead, you'll implement best practices in ML operations and infrastructure engineering while mentoring others on the team to bring out their best. You'll also lead the build in productizing predictive models that help our customers understand their customers and execute a smarter, more informed business strategy.

What You'll Do
Work alongside data scientists to architect end to end ML pipelines that predict complex user behaviors and preferences
Manage and innovate our ML ops infrastructure that helps us ensure the stability and uptime of our predictive modelling suite
Develop and maintain our data science stack, including integrations with pyspark, databricks, MLFlow, and Amperity's own software application
Mentor and help manage an active (and fun) group of machine learning practitioners and data scientists distributed across New York and Seattle
Generate and implement novel ideas for IP in the form of patents, research papers, conference presentations
About You
Undergraduate degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g. computer science, mathematics) with 5+ years of ML software development experience
2+ years of hands-on experience implementing production machine learning systems at scale in Scala, Python, Java, R, or similar languages. Experience with tools like Spark MLlib, MLFlow, Scikit-learn, etc. is a strong plus
Strong background in a broad set of ML concepts ranging from regression to clustering, along with model prototyping, tuning, and evaluation
Extensive experience with distributed computation and specifically Apache Spark; comfortable with evaluating, optimizing, and debugging Spark applications
Domain expertise in probabilistic databases, customer base analyses, or forecasting a strong plus
Ability and desire to synthesize complex ideas for both technical and non-technical audiences. Good communication skills in conducting code reviews, writing technical documentation, and giving internal and external presentations.
Benefits

We offer all the benefits you'd expect from a great place to work: 100% employee healthcare coverage, transportation subsidies, a comfortable work environment with plenty of snacks, and other employee experience perks like events and activities, both in-person and remote. We also offer self-managed PTO and the flexibility to do your best work in the way that works for you. We provide an inclusive environment where you'll be challenged to find and unlock your full potential, surrounded by a team of world-class people driving for excellence.

The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence is a non-profit research institute in Seattle founded by Paul Allen and headed by Professor Oren Etzioni. The core mission of AI2 is to contribute to humanity through high-impact research in artificial intelligence.

In addition to AI2's core mission, we also aim to contribute to humanity through our treatment of each member of the AI2 Team. Some highlights are:

We are a learning organization – because everything AI2 does is ground-breaking, we are learning every day. Similarly, through weekly AI2 Academy lectures, a wide variety of world-class AI experts as guest speakers, and our commitment to your personal on-going education, AI2 is place where you will have opportunities to continue learning alongside your coworkers.
We value diversity - We seek to hire, support, and promote people from all genders, ethnicities, and all levels of experience regardless of age. We particularly encourage applications from women, non-binary individuals, people of color, members of the LGBTQA+ community, and people with disabilities of any kind.
We value inclusion - We understand the value that people's individual experiences and perspectives can bring to an organization, and we are building a culture in which all voices are heard, respected and considered.
We emphasize a healthy work/life balance – we believe our team members are happiest and most productive when their work/life balance is optimized. While we value powerful research results which drive our mission forward, we also value dinner with family, weekend time, and vacation time. We offer generous paid vacation and sick leave as well as family leave.
We are collaborative and transparent – we consider ourselves a team, all moving with a common purpose. We are quick to cheer our successes, and even quicker to share and jointly problem solve our failures.
We are in Seattle – and our office is on the water! We have mountains, we have lakes, we have four seasons, we bike to work, we have a vibrant theater scene, and we have so much else. We even have kayaks for you to paddle right outside our front door. We welcome interest from applicants from outside of the United States.
We are friendly– chances are you will like every one of the 100+ (and growing) people who work here. We do.

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.
