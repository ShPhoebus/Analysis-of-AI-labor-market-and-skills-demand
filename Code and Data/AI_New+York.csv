Senior Developer Advocate - AI & Machine Learning,Grid.ai,New York State•Remote,3.9,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=1a1bc359f32dbcc6&fccid=b5934b25d4f47666&vjs=3,"Who we are

Grid.ai enables companies of all sizes to train state-of-the-art AI models on hundreds of cloud GPUs and TPUs from their laptops. From the creator of the popular framework PyTorch Lightning, Grid is a platform for training models that enables rapid research iteration. Grid aims to simplify scalable AI research so that when a network becomes complex, code doesn't.

Focus on Machine Learning, Not Infrastructure.

Grid.ai is backed by $18.6 million in funding from Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Firstminute. Grid is a remote-first company founded by William Falcon and Luis Capelo.

What's important to us

We are building a company of people that care deeply about the impact of AI on our society. We value:

Integrity: AI is bound to change how we interact with computers, with each other, and the world—for the better. We are committed to building an inclusive company and developing ethical AI that improves humanity.
Perseverance: Be bold, take the initiative, and make decisions with confidence. We empower our community, clients, and colleagues to tackle the impossible.
Curiosity: We are genuinely interested in finding solutions to advance the state of AI research and foster its application in novel products. It's not about whether we can solve the problem, but how.
We also feel that it's essential to point out the self-evident here – there's a genuine lack of diversity in our industry, which has to change. One of our goals is to help drive that change. Grid.ai is fully committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in all of its practices, especially when it comes to growing our team. Our culture promotes inclusion, and we embrace how rewarding it is to work with people from all walks of life.
What We're Looking For

As more developers use Grid and Lightning, we are actively investing in our user communities. This is an opportunity for you to shape the developer experience in the AI space while driving the adoption and utilization of technology that will transform the machine learning ecosystem as a whole. At Grid.ai, developer advocacy centers around 3 tenants:

Community: Our goal is to amplify the community's voice within the company by increasing engagement, gathering feedback, and working together.
Content: From writing blog posts, drafting articles, and producing videos to building demos and developing our documentation, we want to ensure that our users have the resources they need to get started and learn about the latest ways to use Grid and Lightning!
Engineering: At the end of the day, we are all engineers. We connect with developers in the field, foster strong relationships with internal teams, and work together on prioritizing feedback to inform discovery and roadmap development.
What You'll Do
Amplify the Lightning and Grid Community by connecting with users in the community Slack, speaking at meetups and conferences, and hosting Community Office Hours and Technical Community Sprints.
Launch the first Grid and Lightning Ambassadors Program to foster community and create champions for our products.
Write technical content and documentation, including open source repos, blog posts, case studies, and documentation to enable engineers, scientists, and researchers to do more with Grid and Lightning.
Collaborate with the product and engineering teams to share the voice of the community and improve the developer experience as a whole.
Actively build demos on top of lightning using PyTorch, Lightning, and Grid.
Represent the company at conferences and meetups virtually (and across the globe when it's safe) to connect with our community, meet our users, and host fun, engaging events.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a complete set of cloud services that enable all companies, from startups to enterprises, to run virtually everything in the cloud, including mobile applications, big data analytics, AI/ML platforms, and microservices/serverless infrastructures. Startups, which are now primarily born-in-the-cloud, represent a critically important and growing subset of customers to AWS. Funding for healthcare and life science (HCLS) startups has broken records since 2015, as 2 out of every 5 IPOs have been healthcare or life science companies. The healthcare and life science industries possess countless opportunities for innovation and disruption. These companies have unique needs, regulatory considerations, sales cycles, and growth trajectories that distinguish them from traditional companies. These businesses require different engagement strategies and sales motions from sellers to effectively acquire, grow, and retain them long-term on the AWS platform.

As AWS continues to rapidly grow, we seek a US Life Sciences Startup Account Manager to earn trust and help drive the growth of high-potential early, mid, and late stage startups. Your responsibilities will include driving revenue, crafting partnerships, accelerating science, and ensuring new Life Sciences startups select AWS as their primary cloud provider. You will align closely with HCLS counterparts in business development, marketing, solution architecture and partner teams to lead execution of coordinated go-to-market strategies and sales plays. You will also work closely with business development teams who are driving strategic support, global co-programming, and portfolio engagement to help drive top-of-funnel customer acquisition and accelerate seller cycles in the field.

You will be at the heart of the latest sub-industry trends like genomics, biopharma, drug discovery, and medical devices. Your customers will leverage state-of-the-art technologies on AWS to innovate and become the next global HCLS influencers like today’s Illumina, Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Cerner. You need to possess passion about Life Sciences, a self-starter with a strong entrepreneurial spirit who is prepared to work in a fast-paced, often ambiguous environment, execute against ambitious goals, and consistently embrace the Amazon Culture.

Key job responsibilities

Ensure customer success with early, mid and late stage startups
Drive revenue and market share in a defined territory or industry vertical

Position Summary

The Data Science Institute at Columbia University is a world-leading institute in research and education in the theory and practice of the emerging field of data science. The Data Science Institute’s mission is to advance the state of the art in data science, while ensuring the responsible use of data for the benefit of society. As part of this mission, the Institute is partnering with the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that leads proactive efforts to make the federal government more effective, convening stakeholders from across the public and private sectors to solve critical management challenges and deliver results. To drive both innovative approaches and best practices for management of an ambitious data and insights strategy in the public sector, the Institute invites candidates for the Executive in Residence position.

With the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, the OPEN Government Data Act, and the Federal Data Strategy, expectations for evidence-based practice, emphasis on data infrastructure capacity building, and increased rigor and ethical consideration in data-driven decision-making are becoming far more common across the federal government. The grant funded position of Executive in Residence will report to the Director of the Data Science Institute and will spearhead a joint venture between the Partnership for Public Service and the Data Science Institute to advance the federal government’s progress in these areas.

This individual will lay the groundwork for a major initiative to strengthen government’s data science talent pipelines, empower federal leaders to develop a strong data culture, and build problem solving networks across government and academia.

Candidates for this role will be expected to spend time on the Columbia campus and the Partnership office in Washington DC. This individual must have a multidisciplinary background spanning academia and public service, with a thorough understanding of challenges, limitations and opportunities associated with federal data.


Responsibilities

The Executive in Residence will lead and coordinate research, network building, and program design for a range of initiatives, drawing on the Partnership’s extensive experience in leadership development and government management, and the Data Science Institute’s deep data science expertise and networks.

Leadership Data Acumen - Research key gaps and opportunities in preparing federal leaders to engage in data-driven leadership, and organize the development of curriculum addressing these needs (as part of the Partnership’s extensive leadership development programs). The Executive in Residence will be expected to collaborate with members of both DSI and the Partnership for Public Service to ensure success of the program enabling senior executives across government/public service to guide their agencies’ management and utilization of data.

Government Data Science Boot Camp - Assess technical, cultural, and role-design barriers and challenges faced by data scientists entering federal service, and use these findings to support the program design for a “boot camp.” This program is for federal employees performing data science work in government, and will support their onboarding into government missions. The Executive in Residence will ensure the proper design of a training program for early career data talent to introduce them to government ethos, culture, needs and tactics for success with the goal of accelerating their path to productivity.

Federal Data IPA Program - Design, secure interest in and initiate recruitment of an early career data scientist placement program in the federal government, using Intergovernmental Personnel Act Authority, in conjunction with the Partnership’s Talent Exchange program. The Executive in Residence will work to grow networks in the federal government to develop a fellowship program for postdoctoral data scientists and graduate students in the federal government. A goal of this program will be to further define the field of data science and data utilization in government agencies.

Thought Leadership and Network Building - Conduct and advise on cutting-edge research related to federal data maturity, application, needs and opportunity. The Executive in Residence will build connections across the federal government and among academic counterparts to build productive relationships.

Snorkel started as a research project in the Stanford AI Lab in 2016, creating a higher-level interface to machine learning through programmatically labeled and managed training data.

Now, we're building Snorkel Flow to bring our technology to everyone!

Building Snorkel Flow requires outstanding engineers and technologies across the stack, including scalable data pipelines, elegant and intuitive interfaces (both visual and programmatic), state-of-the-art ML modeling techniques, and best practices for seamless deployment. Modern AI approaches require large labeled training datasets to learn from. While traditional approaches typically rely on armies of human annotators to label by hand, Snorkel Flow empowers users to programmatically label and build training data sets to drive a radically faster, more flexible, and higher quality end-to-end AI development process. Snorkel Flow is an end-to-end development platform, complete with a GUI and powerful programmatic interfaces for driving the development process for full AI application workflows: from preprocessing, to programmatic training data creation, to ML model training, to analysis, and deployment.

Proposal Manager and Technical Writer,Enstoa,New York State•Remote,3.5,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=7acca6d7986c12bf&fccid=24a4b71b520a2212&vjs=3,"About Enstoa:

Enstoa is a global thought and practice leader in the digital transformation of managing construction and facilities for health care, natural resources, real estate, and public infrastructure. According to the G20-backed Global Infrastructure Hub, the world needs $94 trillion spent on infrastructure by 2040. This demand with constraints like a labor crunch and increased regulatory requirements are creating massive challenges for company executives. These forces are inspiring many to take a fresh look at how the built environment is developed and operated.

Enstoa gets it and has achieved something rare. As the only company that focuses exclusively on accelerated digital transformation for the built environment, Enstoa introduces entirely new ways of working—ways that can eliminate time and cost from the process. Ways that empower the people who create and maintain the built environment to spend less time chasing down information and more time using it. Enstoa's success is based on use of multidisciplinary project teams which combine built-environment subject matter expertise together with expertise in organizational change, system implementation, integration, data modelling, data analysis and AI/ML.

Responsibilities:

You will help Enstoa win work by helping our teams develop new, distinctive and innovative approaches to proposals that clearly articulate how Enstoa creates value and impact for clients.
As a creative thought leader, you will raise the game on Enstoa's proposals. You'll work closely with colleagues to develop creative, persuasive, and effective proposal communication and experiences. You'll help teams develop and articulate clear, strong value propositions to show how Enstoa is truly different.
Although this role will require significant writing, information coordination is a key skill we're looking for. You will need to collaborate with multiple teams to get the information you need, establish detailed production schedules (especially for proposals), ensure the tone is appropriate for the document, and verify that formatting is consistent. Writing is just one activity that leads to the final product, and these other activities are just as important.
You will manage the end-to-end process of creating new proposals and corporate documents, as well as editing existing documents. The following are among the most important types of documents you'll author and edit, although there will be other types of documents that will require your skilled hand:
Proposals
Client case studies
Employee biographies
Corporate policies and procedures
You will need to balance the art of professional writing with the science of project management. This includes:
Before writing the document, identifying the scope of the document, the intended audience, and the tone we want to convey.
Collaborating across functions to gather the information needed to author or edit documents. Capture, shape, and synthesize information to reflect a cohesive message, written in one voice
Coordinate with external creative agencies that may be leveraged for content, design, or other assets
Writing with precision, succinctly, and with the appropriate amount of context given the intended audience.
Ensuring the written and visual tone of the document are aligned both with how we want to covey the information and represent Enstoa to ensure a consistent story is told from start to finish.
Verifying the formatting of the document is consistent and correct.
You will establish information management practices to ensure documents are accessible. This includes
Establishing a taxonomy of documents including, but not limited to, case studies, employee bios, SOW content library, standard agreements, and order forms
Ensuring documents are appropriately stored in our document library
Appropriate meta data is captured for documents
You will also manage proposal creation. Proposals often have many detailed requirements from the client and specific deadlines, and the management of proposal authoring requires the following activities in addition to the items described above:
You'll make Enstoa's proposals visionary and distinctive by advising on the best media, structure, style, messaging and content.
Reviewing Request for Proposals and extracting the requirements for a complete, compliant proposal
Establishing and managing the schedule and milestones for proposal production, including:
Identifying the activities and information required of other teams, assigning to them tasks with clear deadlines.
Scheduling and leading proposal production coordination meetings.
Engage with pursuit teams strategically, posing questions that encourage a team to consider all aspects of the client's position, and draw out essential messaging.
Write executive summaries that articulate our strategic messaging in a compelling and persuasive manner
Translate technical information and business jargon into clear, consistent, and grammatically correct content
Ensuring we establish—and communicate in the proposal—conditions and qualifications of our proposal. It's equally as important to communicate what is out of scope as it is to communicate what is in scope.
You'll assemble the proposal components and conduct final editing, and proofing to ensure high quality is always maintained.

Who you'll work with:

Enstoa works for clients around the globe. When we're preparing proposals to pursue new work, you'll partner with our delivery teams in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.

Experience:

3-6 years of experience in a business communications-related field

Qualifications:

Skilled strategic writer passionate about influencing business audiences
Demonstrated experience create compelling and crisp written content
Knowledge and experience of competitive proposal/bid processes ideally in a professional services context
Ability to absorb new information and concepts rapidly, and grapple with a wide range of complex business issues
Outstanding editing and persuasive writing skills
Strong critical reasoning and problem-solving skills
Excellent influencing and interpersonal skills
Good presence, credibility and confidence in working with senior colleagues
Empathy and ability to represent the client's perspective in a proposal situation
Flexibility and the ability to gracefully navigate ambiguity, deadline pressure and conflicting requests
Team orientation with a strong sense of commitment to team members and client impact
Sensitivity to and discretion in handling confidential information

Benefits and Perks:

At Enstoa, we strive to constantly improve our processes and work environment. We value collaboration, teamwork, and positive working relationships. We cultivate talent within our organization and we want your career to grow and thrive here! Some of the benefits and perks we offer include:

Generous PTO and Sick Leave Policy
Flexible Work Environment and Telecommuting Options

This includes work on feasibility studies as well as driving the business aspect of a potential prototyping result. This also includes qualifying the engagement to ensure that the investment of an engagement is likely to return a positive business result in the long run for the customer and Amazon.
Execute prototyping engagements in collaboration with Prototyping Architects and the account teams. This execution phase as well as all other phases of prototyping include hands-on technical work with architecture teams, service teams and PAs to develop working, production-scale prototypes with customers. Hence, PEMs have to directly contribute to customer solutions and continuously learn capabilities of existing or new services.
Capture learnings as well as customer feedback from engagements and drive those learnings into the wider organization to improve services and products. PEMs also participate in awareness campaigns as well as spreading technical as well as procedural know-how derived from their engagements internally as well as other customers.
Working alongside Prototyping Engineers and Solutions Architecture leadership, support customers in the exploration, ideation, engineering and delivery of leading edge cloud based innovation across an extensive breadth of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, Analytics, Internet of Things, computer vision and augmented/virtual reality
Qualify, execute and deliver strategic innovation and prototyping outcomes for a range of customers across a broad range of industries and verticals
Create, articulate, and position an innovative and compelling vision and value proposition such that customers realize the financial, technological and transformational value of innovating, prototyping and engineering on the AWS platform
Help customers structure their technical and organizational resources to ensure the maximum benefit can be derived from innovation, prototyping and the adoption of the AWS cloud
Develop extensive executive and senior technical relationships within client organizations; being viewed as a trusted advisor for innovation and cloud technology

A day in the life
PEMs identify opportunities for complex on-site engagements with customers and then execute them end-to-end in collaboration with all parts of the organization, particularly the PAs and SAs. The PEM shows aptitude in working with customer business stakeholders of all levels as well as their senior technical staff during the inception as well as the execution of a prototyping engagement without supervision or guidance. As such, the PEM plays a vital interfacing role between the customer and other parts of the organization such as service or marketing teams. Additionally, a PEM should participate in activities around sharing best practices, evangelism, generating technical content etc. to help scale the organization as a whole. This includes authoring presentations, demos, workshops for internal and external use.

Whether it's delivering personalized experiences, accurately identifying fraud, building predictive AI, or discovering new business opportunities, the ability to run complex queries on multiple streams of data and keep their answers up to date is critical to making better decisions about the changing world around us.

We are focused on bottom-up developer adoption, our core software is free to use and source available, our business model is a cloud product that handles management of Materialize and lets businesses focus on building value. We have a vibrant developer community on Slack and as much as possible we work in public on GitHub.

Who We Are:
The Materialize team includes engineers who were early employees of Cockroach Labs, Flink, Dropbox, and YouTube. Our work builds on top of Timely Dataflow and Differential Dataflow, both created by our co-founder Frank McSherry, a world-leading computer scientist with decades of award-winning research in all aspects of data.

Investors:
Kleiner Perkins, Redpoint Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Additional investors include executives from Cockroach Labs, Datadog, and Rubrik.
What does a Senior Technical Writer at Materialize do?

As a Senior Technical Writer, you will directly report to the Head of Developer Experience (Developer Experience sits independent of Marketing and Product) and own the content that developers use to learn and make the most out of Materialize.

You will do that by becoming an expert on our technology, and acting as the spokesperson for our Documentation, organizing our process, building our style guide, and collaborating with other Technical Writers on the team to support them.

Work will vary across documenting features, creating conceptual overviews, writing guides about solving specific problems with Materialize, and even coming up with SQL and code examples that illustrate how developers can be more successful in working with Materialize.

You will also collaborate with Product Managers, Product Designers, Developer Advocates, and Engineers to build an understanding of the initiatives we're pursuing, and the kind of learning materials which would make them more impactful.

You will be able to work fully remotely, using GitHub and Markdown extensively as writing and collaboration tools.

What are the requirements

We believe that the right person would have the following:

Experience in structuring a writing practice by maintaining the process and supporting tools, along with coaching other Technical Writers
Context about working with developer tools in the data space: e.g. databases, message brokers, ETL tools, data warehouses, general SQL, or other data products.
Ability to convey complex technical concepts in a concise way
Taste for consistent writing, by adopting and evolving a style guide
Good understanding and experience working with GitHub for collaboration (pull requests and reviews)
3+ years of proven experience writing about technical topics, whether this be blog posts, specs, or formal employment as a Technical Writer

The following would also be super helpful:

Hands-on experience building applications or scripts involving a database
Ability to build simple prototypes for testing features to better understand how they work
What's it like to work at Materialize?

You are likely to be a great addition to our team if you:

...have an ownership mindset. As part of a small team, you'll have an outsize impact on decisions and the way things are executed.

...stay nimble. As a growing startup, the team and strategy evolves quickly. Be ready to re-calibrate often and stay flexible.

...be kind and collaborative. Come in ready to share your ideas and listen to feedback.
Remote Work

We are a remote first organisation with an office based in New York City. Whether you work remotely, or from the office in NYC is entirely up to you! We offer generous relocation assistance if you prefer the latter.

What's in it for you
The opportunity to take the lead on key strategic objectives of Materialize and to exercise outsize impact on the overall direction of the organization
Competitive compensation including a commensurate Stock Option Package
401K, or similar retirement funding for non-US residents
Medical Cover, including Dental and Vision (or equivalent for non-US residents)
A generous tech-budget to get you all the latest hardware and software that you need
What is the process like?

Our recruitment process roughly follows the structure below:

Introductory call with the Recruiting Team
First interview with our Head of Developer Experience
Technical Writing Assignment (we provide compensation for this)
Second Interview with one of our Technical Writers
Offer
What do I do now?

If this sounds like an interesting opportunity, please apply via our website, and include your LinkedIn profile (or Resume), writing samples, or anything else that you think might give us a good sense of who you are.

We work collaboratively to set the technical direction for our SaaS products, developing easy-to-use solutions for our customers.

You care about the long-term maintainability of the codebase and will learn to advocate for refactoring and clean-ups where appropriate.

Creativity, ability to solve complex problems without a roadmap

You have a creative mind, attention to detail, and a genuine passion for the craft of software engineering. You love solving problems, learning new technologies, and making data-centric software scale massively.
Tanzu Observability by Wavefront offers many opportunities for applying your creativity and skills to a cutting-edge cloud observability platform that leads the industry in scalability and usability. We are a growing team developing a SaaS product that is used 24/7 by development and site-reliability teams at leading enterprises such as Lyft, Doordash, Reddit, Snowflake, Intuit, Box, Workday, and many more!
What is the primary need, technical challenge, and/or problem you will be responsible for?
You will help deliver exciting new features in the Tanzu Observability backend. You will be working on high-performance data ingestion and querying of metrics, histograms, events, and other data, along with enabling intuitive experiences in the management and organization of dashboarding, alerting, and other observability workflows through backend APIs and processes. Your work may even connect users with AI-assisted suggestions and remediation when customer infrastructure issues are detected.
You will be working closely with software architects, frontend engineers, product managers, and the release and SRE teams as you design and implement these novel features to deliver customer value as a member of the Unified observability subgroup under Tanzu Observability.
You may create new Java REST APIs for a new way to do alerting, then move on to creating new analysis functions built on our streaming query engine, help us reach new highs in data ingestion rate by using our No-SQL key-value store more efficiently, or shorten our release cycles by creating more granular logical micro-services.
Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?
You will work on the Java backend for different pillars of observability (metrics, Distributed Tracing, histograms, events, etc.) for both data querying and ingestion.
You will create and update REST APIs that enable the frontend team to create new UX workflows for dashboarding, alerting, and root cause analysis.
You may collaborate in decomposing and containerizing more of our microservices for Kubernetes.
You will learn to work with distributed No-SQL Key-Value stores at a massive scale, along with various other OLAP and OLTP technologies.
You will write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code with high code coverage.
What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?
You will be part of design and code reviews, collaborating with the greater engineering team to set and maintain a high technical standard.
You will participate in bi-weekly sprints in our agile process and work on features that fit the agile timeline. You will also participate in demos!
You will participate in the learning culture at Tanzu Observability and attend and maybe even give tech talks. You will also likely get to participate in hack-a-thons to showcase your creativity in applied observability.
The technical experience in your background which may help your success in this new role include:
Building Java RESTful backends
Distributed systems and microservice libraries
Knowledge of containerization and Kubernetes.
Experience with observability or monitoring such as Grafana, Prometheus, TICK stack, StatsD, DataDog, or SignalFX, is a plus.
We know from experience that not ticking every box on the skills sections stops many from applying. Please apply regardless of your self-assessment - we want to hear from you! We have seen engineers succeed with a diverse range of skills and experiences.
Culturally, the team is focused on innovation, customer value, execution, growth, and kindness. We retain the original startup DNA in our responsiveness and respect towards everyone’s contributions and focus on exciting big ideas, innovation, and features and fixes that deliver customer value. However, we have the stable backing of VMware, which is itself a values-cherishing company and a great place to work

You have a creative mind, attention to detail, and a genuine passion for the craft of software engineering. You love solving problems, learning new technologies, and making data-centric software scale massively.
Tanzu Observability by Wavefront offers many opportunities for applying your creativity and skills to a cutting-edge cloud observability platform that leads the industry in scalability and usability. We are a growing team developing a SaaS product that is used 24/7 by development and site-reliability teams at leading enterprises such as Lyft, Doordash, Reddit, Snowflake, Intuit, Box, Workday, and many more!
What is the primary need, technical challenge, and/or problem you will be responsible for?
You will help deliver exciting new features in the Tanzu Observability backend. You will be working on high-performance data ingestion and querying of metrics, histograms, events, and other data, along with enabling intuitive experiences in the management and organization of dashboarding, alerting, and other observability workflows through backend APIs and processes. Your work may even connect users with AI-assisted suggestions and remediation when customer infrastructure issues are detected.
You will be working closely with software architects, frontend engineers, product managers, and the release and SRE teams as you design and implement these novel features to deliver customer value as a member of the Unified observability subgroup under Tanzu Observability.
You may create new Java REST APIs for a new way to do alerting, then move on to creating new analysis functions built on our streaming query engine, help us reach new highs in data ingestion rate by using our No-SQL key-value store more efficiently, or shorten our release cycles by creating more granular logical micro-services.
Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?
You will work on the Java backend for different pillars of observability (metrics, Distributed Tracing, histograms, events, etc.) for both data querying and ingestion.
You will create and update REST APIs that enable the frontend team to create new UX workflows for dashboarding, alerting, and root cause analysis.
You may collaborate in decomposing and containerizing more of our microservices for Kubernetes.
You will learn to work with distributed No-SQL Key-Value stores at a massive scale, along with various other OLAP and OLTP technologies.
You will write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code with high code coverage.
What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis?
You will be part of design and code reviews, collaborating with the greater engineering team to set and maintain a high technical standard.
You will participate in bi-weekly sprints in our agile process and work on features that fit the agile timeline. You will also participate in demos!
You will participate in the learning culture at Tanzu Observability and attend and maybe even give tech talks. You will also likely get to participate in hack-a-thons to showcase your creativity in applied observability.
The technical experience in your background which may help your success in this new role include:
Building Java RESTful backends
Distributed systems and microservice libraries
Knowledge of containerization and Kubernetes.
Experience with observability or monitoring such as Grafana, Prometheus, TICK stack, StatsD, DataDog, or SignalFX, is a plus.
We know from experience that not ticking every box on the skills sections stops many from applying. Please apply regardless of your self-assessment - we want to hear from you! We have seen engineers succeed with a diverse range of skills and experiences.
Culturally, the team is focused on innovation, customer value, execution, growth, and kindness. We retain the original startup DNA in our responsiveness and respect towards everyone’s contributions and focus on exciting big ideas, innovation, and features and fixes that deliver customer value. However, we have the stable backing of VMware, which is itself a values-cherishing company and a great place to work

Director of Marketing & Communications,DataKind,New York State•Remote,None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=6f4debbfe236c0c9&fccid=1d8e31f3f2dffe07&vjs=3,"DataKind is looking for a Director of Marketing & Communications!
Location

While most employees are in NYC, this opportunity can be remote just as long as most of the workday will overlap with Eastern Standard Time. (During the COVID-19 pandemic, we're offering flexible scheduling to staff as they manage life demands like childcare alongside their jobs.)

About DataKind

DataKind is a global nonprofit dedicated to harnessing the power of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) in the service of humanity. Named one of Fast Company's 2017 top 10 innovative nonprofits, DataKind teams talented pro bono experts from academia and industry with visionary changemakers to collaboratively design innovative solutions to tough social challenges. We help social organizations apply their data to predictive analytics, machine learning algorithms, and AI needs in a way that both increases impact and prioritizes ethics.

We're 20,000 strong: DataKind volunteers hail from almost every country across the world, representing a community of technologists and social changemakers who believe in using data science and AI for a stronger planet and a more just and prosperous world.
We have served 350+ projects around the world: From using satellite imagery to measure crop yields to automating the fight against hate speech online, our volunteer community has shown up to support a range of humanitarian needs around the world. Through this approach, illustrating what we call ""the art of the possible,"" these projects have resulted in more effective NGOs, more funding for social change organizations, and more awareness of the power (and pitfalls) of data science and AI in the social sector.
People are at the center of our process: The most advanced machine learning algorithms are useless if they're not designed for real people's problems. DataKind celebrates human-centered design principles that focus on the ""why,"" the ""for whom,"" and the ""should we"" long before we ever get going on the ""what.""
""AI for Good"" will only succeed if it's ""AI for All"": We'll continue our work until all people and all communities can use digital technology for the outcomes they want to see. We support not just the tech communities of today, but anyone in any community who wants to lead in how data technologies serve their needs fairly, with an emphasis on including individuals from groups that are historically underrepresented in technology or will be impacted by the intervention.

DataKind has always known that we'll not be able to combat all of the world's looming challenges on the backs of individual, short-term projects alone. We're now focusing the DataKind network on issue areas, including improving health outcomes and increasing economic resilience for all. You can read more about our strategy here.

About the Opportunity

The objectives of most successful organizations are forward-looking, innovative, and sector-changing, but nonprofits all over the world are on a mission to create a better future for the communities they serve, often without the technical capacity to accelerate those paths. We need to shine a light on how advanced solutions like AI, machine learning and robust analytics tools can benefit mission-driven organizations. How do you take really technical and specific use cases and tell compelling, engaging, and creative stories that appeal to a broader audience? That's where you come in!

Reporting to the Chief Operating Officer (COO), the Director of Marketing & Communications will be responsible for building, leading, and coordinating global marketing programs for DataKind. This leader will build DataKind's brand and work closely across teams to develop impactful programs that produce a prospective funder pool, differentiate DataKind from other skilled volunteering programs, and establish us as the go-to technical partner to mission-driven organizations seeking to leverage cutting-edge technology in achieving their respective goals. The Director will advance our work in amplifying our role in tackling systemic challenges. We're looking for a data-driven storyteller who can drive results for us across our PR, communications, and marketing goals.

In this role, the Director will manage one full-time member but will be supported by a PR firm through June 2022, two to three consultants, and a graphic designer for much, if not all, of FY22. The Director will work closely with other team leaders in Programs, the Development team, and the CEO.

You're a strategic leader who also enjoys getting your hands dirty in the execution. Whether it's on your own or through others, you get the nuts and bolts in place in record time, always with support and input from the rest of the organization.
You enjoy cultivating relationships with reporters, journalists, and media outlets in support of growing a brand. In fact, you already have relationships you can leverage and are eager to continue those that DataKind has established over the years.

Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets.We accomplish this by leveraging domain experts to create semantically rich training data on the order of less than 1% of the data from which our models continuously learn. As a result, we are able to produce a non-linear return on the cognitive effort expended by domain experts. Our dynamic continuously learning models, activated by proprietary mathematical functions, underlie an AI platform with a variety of core capabilities including intelligent web crawling, contextual analytics and semantic search. Leveraging these core capabilities, we build smart analytical tools that continuously read, understand and learn in specialized ways. As our smart analytical tools learn, they extract hidden features buried in complexity that surface predictive insights that would be impossible to find using traditional intelligence and tools.Our products are helping customers generate alpha by identifying and ranking sources most likely to publish reliable, market moving M&A rumors; monitor important shifts in topical nuance based on the interplay between management commentary and analyst questions in earnings transcripts; and monitor patient chatter on the efficacy and safety of clinical drug trials. As such, our proprietary mathematical framework powered by machine learning algorithms and recurring deep learning neural networks have allowed us to derive valuable contextual insight and deliver value industries, such as Financial Services, Healthcare, Real Estate, Music and the government space.If you’re the right person for the job, we look forward to hearing from you!Job Type: Full-timePay: $90,000.00 - $110,000.00 per yearBenefits:401(k)Dental insuranceHealth insurancePaid time offVision insuranceSchedule:Monday to FridaySupplemental Pay:Bonus payApplication Question(s):Are you a U.S. Citizen or Permanent Resident?Language:Mandarin Chinese (Required)Work Location:Fully RemoteThis Job Is Ideal for Someone Who Is:Dependable -- more reliable than spontaneousDetail-oriented -- would rather focus on the details of work than the bigger pictureAchievement-oriented -- enjoys taking on challenges, even if they might failCompany's website:https://www.accrete.ai"

Special Notice
• This position is temporarily available through 30 April 2022 with possibility of extension depending on post and funds availability. If the selected candidate is a staff member from the United Nations Secretariat, the selection will be administered as a temporary assignment.

While this temporary assignment may provide the successful applicant with an opportunity to gain new work experience, the selection for this position is for a limited period and has no bearing on the future incumbency of the post. An external candidate selected for this position is bound by the prevailing condition of the staff selection system under ST/AI/2010/3, as amended, and ST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1. A staff member holding a temporary appointment who is recruited in the Professional and above categories on a temporary appointment, and placed on a position authorized for one year or longer may not apply for or be reappointed to his/her current position within six months of the end of his/her current service. This provision does not apply to staff members holding temporary appointments and placed on positions authorized for one year or more in duty stations authorized for peacekeeping operations or special political missions.
Subject to the funding source of the position, this temporary job opening may be limited to candidates based at the duty station.
Staff members are not eligible to apply for the current temporary job opening if they are unable to serve the specified duration of temporary need before reaching the mandatory age of separation. Submitting an application or selection for the current temporary job opening does not delay or increase the mandatory age of separation.
Staff members of the United Nations common system organizations who will reach the mandatory age of separation or retirement within the duration of the current temporary need period are not eligible to apply.
A current staff member who holds a fixed-term, permanent or continuing appointment may apply for temporary positions no more than one level above his or her current grade. However, a current staff member who holds an appointment at the G-6 or G-7 level may also apply to temporary positions in the Professional category up to and including the P-3 level, subject to meeting all eligibility and other requirements for the position. A staff member holding a temporary appointment shall be regarded as an external candidate when applying for other positions, and may apply for other temporary positions at any level, subject to section 5.7 below and staff rule 4.16 (b) (ii). Therefore, a staff member holding a temporary appointment in the General Service or related categories may only apply to positions within those categories. For full information on eligibility requirements, please refer to section 5 of ST/AI/2010/4Rev.1 on Temporary Appointments. In its resolution 66/234, the General Assembly further “stressed that the Secretary-General should not recur to the practice of temporarily filling posts in the Professional and higher categories with General Service staff members who have not passed the General Service to Professional category examination other than on an exceptional basis, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that temporary occupation of such posts by the General Service staff shall not exceed a period of one year, effective 1 January 2013…” Consequently, eligible candidates in the General Service or related categories for temporary job openings in the Professional category that have not passed the competitive examination may be selected only on an exceptional basis endorsed by the Office of Human Resources Management where no other suitable candidate could be identified.
Upon separation from service, including, but not limited to, expiration or termination of, or resignation from, a fixed-term, continuing or permanent appointment, a former staff member will be ineligible for re-employment on the basis of a temporary appointment for a period of 31 days following the separation. In the case of separation from service on retirement, a former staff member will be ineligible for re-employment for a period of three months following the separation. This equally applies, mutatis mutandis, with respect to a former or current staff member who has held or holds an appointment in another entity applying the United Nations Staff Regulations and Rules and who applies for a temporary position with the Secretariat.
Retirees above the mandatory age of separation who wish to be considered for the current temporary job opening must indicate the reason for their last separation as ""retirement."" Such retirees shall not be employed by the Organization, unless (a) the operational requirements of the Organization cannot be met by staff members who are qualified and available to perform the required functions; and (b) the proposed employment would not adversely affect the career development or redeployment opportunities of other staff members and represents both a cost-effective and operationally sound solution to meet the needs of the service.
The expression “Internal candidates”, shall mean staff members who have been recruited after a competitive examination under staff rule 4.16 or after the advice of a central review body under staff rule 4.15.
Please note that candidates will be required to meet the requirements of Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter as well as the requirements of the position. The United Nations is committed to the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity for all its human resources, including but not limited to respect for international human rights and humanitarian law. Candidates may be subject to screening against these standards, including but not limited to whether they have committed, or are alleged to have committed criminal offences and/or violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law.
For information on special post allowance, please refer to ST/AI/1999/17. For more details on the administration of temporary appointments please refer to ST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1.

United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer, or promotion of staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. By accepting an offer of appointment, United Nations staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and assignment by him or her to any activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c). In this context, all internationally recruited staff members shall be required to move periodically to discharge new functions within or across duty stations under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

At the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the recruitment and employment of staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, with due regard to geographic diversity.

United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

In case of selection, a staff member of the United Nations Secretariat who meets the definition of “internal candidate” in staff rule 4.10 will be placed on a temporary assignment if he or she holds the same grade as the job opening; and a temporary promotion if he or she holds a lower grade than the job opening. If the regular incumbent vacates the position during such temporary assignment or promotion, the selected staff member will be laterally assigned, promoted or transferred to the position without further selection process under ST/AI/2010/3.

At the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the recruitment and employment of staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, with due regard to geographic diversity. All employment decisions are made on the basis of qualifications and organizational needs. The United Nations is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment of mutual respect. The United Nations recruits and employs staff regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religious, cultural and ethnic backgrounds or disabilities. Reasonable accommodation for applicants with disabilities may be provided to support participation in the recruitment process when requested and indicated in the application.

Submitting an application or selection for the current temporary job opening does not delay or increase the mandatory age of separation.

Retirees above the mandatory age of separation who wish to be considered for the current temporary job opening must indicate the reason for their last separation as ""retirement."" Such retirees shall not be employed by the Organization, unless

(a) the operational requirements of the Organization cannot be met by staff members who are qualified and available to perform the required functions; and (b) the proposed employment would not adversely affect the career development or redeployment opportunities of other staff members and represents both a cost-effective and operationally sound solution to meet the needs of the service.

While this temporary assignment may provide the successful applicant with an opportunity to gain new work experience, the selection for this position is for a limited period and has no bearing on the future incumbency of the post.
This post is financed by Regular Budget.
Subject to the funding source of the position, the eligibility for this temporary job opening may be limited to candidates based at the duty station.
This temporary job opening may be limited to “internal candidates,” who have been recruited through a competitive examination administered according to staff rule 4.16 or staff selection process including the review of a central review body established according to staff rule 4.15.

Pursuant to section 7.11 of ST/AI/2012/2/Rev.1, candidates recruited through the young professionals programme who have not served for a minimum of two years in the position of their initial assignment are not eligible to apply to this position.

Staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and to assignment by him or her. In this context, all staff are expected to move periodically to new functions in their careers in accordance with established rules and procedures.
United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer, or promotion of staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. By accepting an offer of appointment, United Nations staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and assignment by him or her to any activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c). In this context, all internationally recruited staff members shall be required to move periodically to discharge new functions within or across duty stations under conditions established by the Secretary-General.


Applicants are urged to follow carefully all instructions available in the online recruitment platform, inspira. For more detailed guidance, applicants may refer to the Manual for the Applicant, which can be accessed by clicking on “Manuals” hyper-link on the upper right side of the inspira account-holder homepage.

The evaluation of applicants will be conducted on the basis of the information submitted in the application according to the evaluation criteria of the job opening and the applicable internal legislations of the United Nations including the Charter of the United Nations, resolutions of the General Assembly, the Staff Regulations and Rules, administrative issuances and guidelines. Applicants must provide complete and accurate information pertaining to their personal profile and qualifications according to the instructions provided in inspira to be considered for the current job opening. No amendment, addition, deletion, revision or modification shall be made to applications that have been submitted.

It is the essential source of information and ideas that make sense of a world in constant transformation. The WIRED conversation illuminates how technology is changing every aspect of our lives—from culture to business, science to design. The breakthroughs and innovations that we uncover lead to new ways of thinking, new connections, and new industries. WIRED reaches more than 30 million people each month through WIRED.com, our digital edition, the magazine, social media, and live events.
Job Description
The largest technology companies exercise world-changing market power. WIRED seeks a writer to cover these companies, with a particular focus on Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple.
This role spans both the business/economic and social impacts of these companies’ power, and your underlying question will always be how this power is changing the world, both for better and for worse. You’ll track these companies as they expand into new markets and business lines, exploring the potential of new products and economic opportunities they create, and reporting on the strategies they use to outmaneuver or quash competitors and influence regulators, politicians, and the public. You may also cover them through the stories of their smaller rivals, of companies that depend on their economic ecosystems—such as sellers on Amazon or app developers for Apple—or of regulators or activists who tussle with them. You may look at how they tackle issues like misinformation and political manipulation, how they use their platforms to try to promote positive change such as voter participation or public health, and how their founders or top executives use their wealth philanthropically. And you may look at their influence around the world, particularly how they wield it in smaller countries or those with authoritarian regimes.
You should have some experience of covering Big Tech, and be excited by the prospect of storytelling across a wide range of formats, from breaking news and sharp, timely analysis to deeply reported narrative features. (If you’ve never written one of those, don’t worry: WIRED has some of the finest longform editors in the business, and we love helping people who’ve got reporting chops and raw writing talent grow into gifted storytellers.) You may also have the opportunity to take part in our podcasts, video series, or live events.
You’ll work with our experienced business editor, Scott Thurm, who will help you find avenues to focus on within this broad beat and develop lines of investigation that can yield scoops and original ideas. You’ll be part of a growing and increasingly global newsroom of smart, kind, nerdy, and well-informed colleagues who are always brimming with ideas and eager to help each other out. In particular, in this job you can expect to collaborate with folks such as Gilad Edelman, who covers tech policy and regulation; Cecilia D’Anastasio, our chief writer on the games industry, Tom Simonite, Will Knight, and Khari Johnson, our AI team; and Matt Burgess, who covers privacy and regulation in Europe.
Pandemic permitting, you can work out of WIRED’s offices in San Francisco, New York or London, but if you live in the United States or UK outside those cities you can be based remotely.
Primary responsibilities:
Pitch, report, and write stories on platforms and power beat, balancing news and analysis of the most important stories with original investigative reporting, features, or essays
Collaborate with other members of the business and national affairs teams in shaping the WIRED coverage agenda for Big Tech-related issues
Collaborate with audio, video, events, and social media teams as needed to develop ways of telling stories on other platforms
Skills and qualifications:
Experience as a technology or business journalist with a track record of original reporting on Big Tech
A clear, engaging, jargon-free writing style

We change the World; you will become passionate about your employer and the brand you represent. Everything is converging on the Internet, making networked connections more meaningful than ever before in our lives. Our employees' groundbreaking ideas impact everything. Here, that means we take creative ideas from the drawing board to dynamic solutions that have real world impact. You'll collaborate with Cisco leaders, partner with mentors, and develop incredible relationships with colleagues who share your interest in connecting the unconnected. You'll be part a team that cares about its customers, enjoys having fun, and you'll take part in changing the lives of those in our local communities. Come prepared to be encouraged and inspired.

What You’ll Accomplish

As a Collaboration Product Sales Specialist, you’ll play a vital role in the success of the Cisco Field Sales and Collaboration Technology Group.

Establish and maintain customer relationships with IT, executives, HR, training, sales and procurement.
Sell the full suite of our Collaboration products, software, solutions, and services to new and existing customers.
Build Cisco's relevance in delivering Cloud Collaboration Experiences - solution development, partner ecosystem, marketing, etc.
Lead and orchestrate Cisco and Partner resources to identify & qualify opportunities, close engagements to achieve product and services bookings targets.

Who You’ll Work With

Direct alignment with the Americas Account Teams as well as many Business Unit resources and partners. You will be embracing unprecedented innovation and tremendous opportunity for growth. You will succeed because as a team we listen to our customers and anticipate their needs as the market shifts and technology transitions accelerate. Our customers are versatile, agile and adopt technology fast to compete passionately and grow their business. The collaboration team provides you with unlimited opportunities to succeed at Cisco. Our culture will support and empower you.

Who You Are

Are you a technical seller who understands how meaningful collaboration technology is and can convert your deep technical expertise into business acumen that your customers can easily absorb and repeat? Do you love thinking creatively and overcoming objections? Then this is the position for you. Do you have experience selling Cisco specific products and “as a Service” selling experience? Then that’s even better!

We Are Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

Special Notice
• This position is temporarily available through 30 April 2022 with possibility of extension depending on post and funds availability. If the selected candidate is a staff member from the United Nations Secretariat, the selection will be administered as a temporary assignment.

While this temporary assignment may provide the successful applicant with an opportunity to gain new work experience, the selection for this position is for a limited period and has no bearing on the future incumbency of the post. An external candidate selected for this position is bound by the prevailing condition of the staff selection system under ST/AI/2010/3, as amended, and ST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1. A staff member holding a temporary appointment who is recruited in the Professional and above categories on a temporary appointment, and placed on a position authorized for one year or longer may not apply for or be reappointed to his/her current position within six months of the end of his/her current service. This provision does not apply to staff members holding temporary appointments and placed on positions authorized for one year or more in duty stations authorized for peacekeeping operations or special political missions.
Subject to the funding source of the position, this temporary job opening may be limited to candidates based at the duty station.
Staff members are not eligible to apply for the current temporary job opening if they are unable to serve the specified duration of temporary need before reaching the mandatory age of separation. Submitting an application or selection for the current temporary job opening does not delay or increase the mandatory age of separation.
Staff members of the United Nations common system organizations who will reach the mandatory age of separation or retirement within the duration of the current temporary need period are not eligible to apply.
A current staff member who holds a fixed-term, permanent or continuing appointment may apply for temporary positions no more than one level above his or her current grade. However, a current staff member who holds an appointment at the G-6 or G-7 level may also apply to temporary positions in the Professional category up to and including the P-3 level, subject to meeting all eligibility and other requirements for the position. A staff member holding a temporary appointment shall be regarded as an external candidate when applying for other positions, and may apply for other temporary positions at any level, subject to section 5.7 below and staff rule 4.16 (b) (ii). Therefore, a staff member holding a temporary appointment in the General Service or related categories may only apply to positions within those categories. For full information on eligibility requirements, please refer to section 5 of ST/AI/2010/4Rev.1 on Temporary Appointments. In its resolution 66/234, the General Assembly further “stressed that the Secretary-General should not recur to the practice of temporarily filling posts in the Professional and higher categories with General Service staff members who have not passed the General Service to Professional category examination other than on an exceptional basis, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that temporary occupation of such posts by the General Service staff shall not exceed a period of one year, effective 1 January 2013…” Consequently, eligible candidates in the General Service or related categories for temporary job openings in the Professional category that have not passed the competitive examination may be selected only on an exceptional basis endorsed by the Office of Human Resources Management where no other suitable candidate could be identified.
Upon separation from service, including, but not limited to, expiration or termination of, or resignation from, a fixed-term, continuing or permanent appointment, a former staff member will be ineligible for re-employment on the basis of a temporary appointment for a period of 31 days following the separation. In the case of separation from service on retirement, a former staff member will be ineligible for re-employment for a period of three months following the separation. This equally applies, mutatis mutandis, with respect to a former or current staff member who has held or holds an appointment in another entity applying the United Nations Staff Regulations and Rules and who applies for a temporary position with the Secretariat.
Retirees above the mandatory age of separation who wish to be considered for the current temporary job opening must indicate the reason for their last separation as ""retirement."" Such retirees shall not be employed by the Organization, unless (a) the operational requirements of the Organization cannot be met by staff members who are qualified and available to perform the required functions; and (b) the proposed employment would not adversely affect the career development or redeployment opportunities of other staff members and represents both a cost-effective and operationally sound solution to meet the needs of the service.
The expression “Internal candidates”, shall mean staff members who have been recruited after a competitive examination under staff rule 4.16 or after the advice of a central review body under staff rule 4.15.
Please note that candidates will be required to meet the requirements of Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter as well as the requirements of the position. The United Nations is committed to the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity for all its human resources, including but not limited to respect for international human rights and humanitarian law. Candidates may be subject to screening against these standards, including but not limited to whether they have committed, or are alleged to have committed criminal offences and/or violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law.
For information on special post allowance, please refer to ST/AI/1999/17. For more details on the administration of temporary appointments please refer to ST/AI/2010/4/Rev.1.

The United Nations recruits and employs staff regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religious, cultural and ethnic backgrounds or disabilities.

United Nations Considerations
According to article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, the paramount consideration in the employment of the staff is the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. Candidates will not be considered for employment with the United Nations if they have committed violations of international human rights law, violations of international humanitarian law, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment, or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have been involved in the commission of any of these acts. The term “sexual exploitation” means any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. The term “sexual abuse” means the actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. The term “sexual harassment” means any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, and when the gravity of the conduct warrants the termination of the perpetrator’s working relationship. Candidates who have committed crimes other than minor traffic offences may not be considered for employment.

Due regard will be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. The United Nations places no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs. The United Nations Secretariat is a non-smoking environment.

The paramount consideration in the appointment, transfer, or promotion of staff shall be the necessity of securing the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and integrity. By accepting an offer of appointment, United Nations staff members are subject to the authority of the Secretary-General and assignment by him or her to any activities or offices of the United Nations in accordance with staff regulation 1.2 (c). In this context, all internationally recruited staff members shall be required to move periodically to discharge new functions within or across duty stations under conditions established by the Secretary-General.

With the explosion of information and data online, search has never been more important. However, while the world of consumer search has innovated over time, enterprise search has not. In fact, the majority of enterprise search is powered by outdated keyword technology that only scans for keywords and delivers a list of hyperlinks rather than actually answering questions. Yext, the AI Search Company, offers a modern, AI-powered Answers Platform that understands natural language so that when people ask questions about a business online they get direct answers – not links.

We have a big, audacious mission to transform the enterprise with AI search. To achieve that, we need bright minds and diverse perspectives to join our growing company and help us continue to disrupt an industry. Does this sound like you?
At Yext, we believe that the ability to learn is not fixed, and that isn't only ingrained in our business model, but also with our employees.

Learn to interpret client and internal partner requests and effectively communicate needs to various teams.
Test new features and deliver meaningful product feedback.
Manage and execute multiple projects simultaneously, including setting goals, developing timelines, and task completion.
Cross-collaborate with teams to not only meet but exceed our client expectations.

Expertise in Yext Products, Platform and Business while carving out a career path for yourself emphasizing your strengths and learned skills.

Upon completion of all 3 rotations and strong performance reviews, analysts will be eligible to interview for full-time placement on a participating team.

What You Have

Bachelor's degree, master's degree, or similar college-level education with a graduation date before December 2020.
1+ years of professional & non-internship experience post-graduation in but not limited to, operations, consulting, project management, financial services, or a similar analyst role.

At Runway, we’re building a next-generation creative tool that enables a new level of interactivity with cloud-based machine learning models. For our tool to be maximally expressive, it needs to establish a seamless feedback loop between its users and the machine learning models powering its abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible.
For this reason, we’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can help us create the server-side engine that powers our interactive tools for image and video synthesis. You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments. The best fit for the role is someone who is deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems design, and has extensive experience building web-based real-time server applications.
This is a full-time role. We are based in New York, but welcome remote applications from everywhere
About the company
Runway is building the next generation of creative tools. We are a small team of artists, engineers, developers, and researchers working together to predict-by-inventing the future. Our team members used to work at NYU, Disney Research, IBM Research, Linode, and Stanford.
We have built a tool that makes machine learning easy and accessible for all types of creatives. And our users love it. But our vision is bigger. We are transforming how content and media is created. For decades, media creation has relied on incremental iterations of the same old tools. And while some of those tools have become smarter in recent years, they're still very much rooted in an outdated paradigm. We've been stuck with the same old Creative Suite for way too long. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will not just bring automation at every scale, but a significant change in how we create. That's why Runway is reimagining how we create, so we can create new things.

Runway has an active and growing community of artists and creators all over the world. IBM, Google, R/GA, New Balance, Chanel, and dozen of companies are using Runway to create and explore new creative boundaries. Runway is also used to teach at a wide variety of institutions. From architectural programs at MIT to self-organized independent workshops in Perú.
We are a young company and this role is a unique opportunity to join a market-defining company in its early stages.
Requirements:
Solid knowledge of at least one machine learning research framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), and at least one high-performance inference framework (e.g. TensorRT, Apache TVM).
Experience profiling and optimizing deep neural networks, including knowledge of GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight.
Familiarity with Python-based image and video manipulation/encoding/decoding frameworks, such as OpenCV and PyAV.
Experience with cloud orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.
Opinionated about writing robust and maintainable client-server architectures and APIs.
Ability to rapidly prototype solutions and iterate on them with tight product deadlines.
Strong communication, collaboration, and documentation skills."

Provide data science expertise both to customers and internally to Dataiku’s sales and marketing teams
Develop custom Python or R-based “plugins” in collaboration with Solutions, R&D, and Product teams, to enhance Dataiku’s functionality

Curiosity and a desire to learn new topics and skills
Empathy for others and an eagerness to share your knowledge and expertise with your colleagues, Dataiku’s customers, and the general public
The ability to clearly explain complex topics to technical as well as non-technical audiences
2 - 10 years of experience with ML tools (e.g., Python, R)
