Proactive & flexible:You are able to hit the ground running, you take responsibility for finding a way to get the job done. You learn as quickly as possible and sometimes do things outside the immediate scope of your work, giving it all you've got.
Strong work-ethic: You've mastered healthy habits in your life that allow you to do great things. You exemplify dedication and commitment to coming up with very good results in your work and inspire others to do the same.
Growth mindset: You believe abilities – like intelligence and talent – can be developed through dedication and hard work. You see failure as an opportunity to grow and welcome feedback as a pathway to your continued success.
Humble: You recognize that you are one among many, and you hold a genuine desire to discover what other people can offer. You are intrigued by how others think, and how others feel differently from you. You lean into these moments with patience and curiosity.

Software Engineer - Frontend,Sisu,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA+2 locations",4.0,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=e94e8a11b4c47ad8&fccid=ade8b9795a68d1d6&vjs=3,"At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.
Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, and past behaviors. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.
As a Sr. Frontend Engineer, you’ll be a subject matter expert shaping the future of Sisu’s product interface - a web application that our customers will rely on to “get the facts” to make data driven decisions. You’ll have the opportunity to work on technical challenges including developing our information architecture and solving unique problems, including how to represent statistical data in a digestible way to end users of various knowledge levels.
What you'll do
Scale our Typescript / React / Redux front-end
Provide technical leadership to drive consensus based on empirical evidence
Navigate ambiguity with an open and curious cross-functional team
Understand our end user (data analyst) to eventually build a general use product
Craft a unique user experience that brings value to global brands. See Samsung and Upwork.
Actively partner with product and design to architect user empowering interfaces with performance and scalability in mind
Cultivate your design skills and transform Figma mocks into working prototypes
Shape the engineering culture through mentorship as our small, dynamic team grows
Actively participate in customer POCs to optimize customer experience and adoption.
About you
Experience building user-facing products
Expertise with React and Redux
Expertise with Javascript or Typescript
Fluency in HTML, CSS, and ES6
Capable of coaching team members, by translating complex nuances related to the languages and libraries we use, in easy to understand terms.
Proficient in utilizing and designing REST and/or GraphQL APIs
Excellent communication skills for collaborating internally with partner teams and externally with our customers and end users"

A tight integration of biology and machine learning is at our core, and we're building a rare team of scientists and computational folks that work together closely, fighting disease.

Impact
Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.


Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Yes, you belong
We are building a cross-functional team. We don't expect you to have a background in machine learning, just as we don't expect our computational folks to be expert biologists. We do expect our teams to work respectfully and closely, learning together every day.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.

Record of past successes. You have a track record of successful execution of multiple scientific projects, ideally in both industry and academia.
Education. PhD (or similar experience) in aging biology, cell biology, genetics, or related fields.
Familiarity w/ microscopy and cell culture. Meaningful experience with both fluorescence microscopy and cell culture work.
Open-minded and collaborative. You're excited to work closely with experts in a different field (machine learning), learn from each other, and incorporate brand new approaches into your expertise.
Broad proficiency. You've shown proficiency in a wide range of in vitro and in vivo research approaches.
Tends towards ownership. You do anything necessary to solve the problem at hand.
Maturity in face of ambiguity. You help define questions instead of just answering them. You work to resolve ambiguity — and you're comfortable making decisions when it remains.
Crisp communicator. You excel at crisp, concise written or spoken communication. You love learning and teaching others in a cross-functional team (we're biologists, computational folks, and more).
Driven by impact. You're most motivated when working on a problem of important consequence, no matter what's necessary to do so.

Research Engineer,Span.IO,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/company/Span.IO/jobs/Research-Engineer-b57b523d7b1a0f01?fccid=764e5e1f9b11dc9a&vjs=3,"The MissionThe electrical grid was built to carry electricity unidirectionally from central fossil fuel plants to end consumers. As we transition to a renewable future built from rooftop solar and community storage, the grid itself needs an overhaul. Span's goal is to re-invent the grid from a clean slate to enable that transition, envisioning a grid made of distributed control systems and software as much as copper wires.To accomplish this, we are upgrading the breaker panel — the humble box sitting at the center of every building's electrical wiring — to monitor, control, and make decisions about energy. This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.Span's unique commitment to clean-slate ""right architecture"" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.The RoleSpan has two core theses:To solve climate change efficiently and quickly, every building should have a built-in energy management system (EMS)* — i.e. a Linux computer with the ability to measure and control the flow of energy;Buildings with an EMS can be smarter and better to live in than today's buildings.As Span's first research engineer to focus specifically on appliance monitoring, you will help us pursue the dream of #2. We're working on making the EMS into an excellent consumer product. We believe that the data that an EMS has access to — i.e. instantaneous current for every circuit in the house — can give tremendously valuable insights into what's happening in the house. We believe that a good EMS ought to be able to detect appliance failures before they happen; prevent electrical fires; help homeowners operate their houses more efficiently; and act as a guide to homeowners as they go through the journey of electrification.You'll put the rubber to the road for this project, working with Span's data scientists and engineers to research the right algorithms, plan and execute experiments, and build characterization databases. You'll build data acquisition rigs with Span's top-caliber hardware engineers; acquire, install, instrument, and break a variety of appliances; and analyze data and plan experiments with our top-caliber data scientists. You'll balance a program budget (modest to start) and have wide leeway to inform the direction of our research and corresponding feature development. Unlike grad school, you'll be supported by technicians, engineers, and data scientists.Finally, as concepts become fully baked, you'll work with the systems integration, hardware, software, and data teams to implement your findings for our fleet of panels, taking the process full circle from experimentation to application. This might look like writing cloud or device side algorithms, speccing new monitoring tech for future products, or running analysis on the back end to inform strategic business decisions.There are multiple reasons, as we'll discuss in our upcoming inaugural engineering blog post. Primary in our minds are service-upgrade-avoidance for electrification; demand-side management; and distributed grid.ResponsibilitiesServe as subject-matter expert for how appliances work, their electrical signatures, and how they failRead the academic literature to understand appliance failure modes and analytical techniques for identifying themBuild physics models of appliances to generate simulated data sets and train modelsWork with Span hardware engineers to assemble and maintain data acquisition hardware rigs and data ingest systems for appliance current characterizationOwn the Span appliance lab, working with Span technicians to buy, install, and instrument appliancesIntroduce faults into appliances and characterize them using your data acquisition hardwareWork with the data science team to analyze data, develop and test algorithms, and plan tests and experimentsServe as technical point of contact with appliance OEMs and other technical partnersHelp drive product/business strategy — determine which appliances/OEMs to work with, identify highest risks and clearest targetsNote: We're a startup, and everyone here wears multiple hats; so you'll inevitably end up working on other projects!

About Freenome

Freenome is on a mission to empower everyone with the tools they need to detect, treat, and ultimately prevent cancer.

We have pioneered the most comprehensive multiomics platform for early cancer detection through a routine blood draw. By combining deep expertise in molecular biology with advanced computational biology and machine learning techniques to recognize disease-associated patterns among billions of circulating, cell-free biomarkers, we are developing simple and accurate blood tests for early cancer detection and integrating the actionable insights into health systems to operationalize a machine learning feedback loop between care and science.

Our recent $270 Million Series C brings our financing to over $500 million from investors, including; Bain Capital, Perceptive Advisors, RA Capital, Polaris Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., GV (formerly Google Ventures), Roche Venture Fund, Kaiser Permanente Ventures, American Cancer Society’s BrightEdge Ventures, Data Collective Venture Capital, Novartis and Verily Life Sciences.

Our Science

Freenome is building technology to advance the understanding of cancer through multiple analytes derived from blood. These signals include cell-free DNA, methylation of cell-free DNA, cell-free RNA, circulating proteins, and immune profiling derived from thousands of prospective samples. By developing novel statistical learning methods and applying them to integrate various -omics datasets, Freenome is a leader in modeling specific biological mechanisms to capture disease-dependent signatures, including gene expression, immune response, tumor burden, the tissue of origin, and 3D chromatin structure.

By building comprehensive discovery datasets and modeling critical biological systems, Freenome is learning what biological changes are present within the blood between a variety of different disease states, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, infections, drug response, and aging. The synthesis of Freenome’s datasets, cross-functional technical expertise, and audacious mission to discover biological truth, we seek to improve the lives of millions through early detection and early treatment of disease.

Our Culture

Freenomers are technical, creative, visionary, grounded, empathetic, and passionate. We build teams around divergent expertise, allowing us to solve problems and ascertain opportunities in unique ways. Freenomers are some of the most talented experts in their fields, joining together to advance healthcare, one breakthrough at a time.

We value empathy, integrity, and trust in one another, and we respect the diverse perspectives of our colleagues and those we serve. We assume positive intent and give each other the benefit of the doubt with the firm belief that we are a team working toward the same objectives. We believe in empowering and supporting each other in a collaborative and dynamic environment.

What does a successful person look like at Freenome?

Those who thrive at Freenome prioritize, manage, and execute their own goals with ownership and alignment with those of the company. They embrace our values of empathy, integrity, striving for greatness, servant leadership, trust, and holding themselves and their team accountable to these values. They crave collaboration with brilliant minds from disparate fields of study and believe that hiring and mentorship are fundamental to our success. Above all, they welcome and provide constructive feedback and criticism, trusting in others’ good intentions, and being secure in knowing that embracing mistakes is the best way to learn and grow. For those who pursue challenges, understudied problems, and want the opportunity to see their work impact the lives of millions of people affected by cancer every year, there’s no better place to be than Freenome.

Applied Scientist,Afresh,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted29 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=9e8950e06a36982c&fccid=cd4725921f2c98aa&vjs=3,"Afresh is on a mission to reduce food waste and increase access to nutritious food globally by transforming the fresh food supply chain. Our solution is currently deployed in hundreds of grocery stores across the United States and is on track to reduce 30 million pounds of food waste per year with our existing customers alone. By 2021, we're aiming to reduce food waste by a quarter billion pounds per year.

The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies.

We are looking for an Applied Scientist to lead the R&D work at Afresh. You will take your existing knowledge of forecasting, simulation, and stochastic optimization and apply it to the challenging and important problem of perishable inventory control. You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core replenishment system. This will include modeling consumer demand, item-level perishability, and complex multi-echelon supply chains. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.
What you will do:
You will work on improving the core models of our system: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and simulation. You will also lead research development for new product and business challenges. You will model the complex problems of inventory decay, promotions, price elasticity, and inventory uncertainty, and implement solutions to multi-stage and multi-echelon inventory optimization problems.
In your first 3 months, you will acquire an encyclopedic knowledge of perishable inventory control and Afresh's core decision making problem. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and simulation tools, and you'll test an experimental improvement to our demand forecasting, ordering, or simulation models.
By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to our core modeling system.
By the end of your first year, you will have led the implementation of fundamental changes to our core system and led research into new product areas (warehouse level replenishment, production planning).
We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof. This is not an analytics team.
What skills and experience do you need?
5+ years of industrial or academic experience building systems that deal with large-scale decision making under uncertainty. Some possible prior research areas are inventory optimization, supply chain management, network optimization, forecasting, game theory, decision analysis, or stochastic and approximate dynamic programming.
Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English and easily translate business requirements into constrained optimization problems.
Ability to independently deliver high quality software implementations of your solutions in the Python data stack (numpy/torch/pandas/etc). Knowing Python before joining is not required.
PhD in Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related quantitative field

Founded in 2017, Afresh is the first A.I.-powered fresh food optimization platform for grocery chains. We have partnered with several large grocers representing hundreds of stores and >$10B in revenue. Our cutting-edge AI research has been published in top journals (e.g., ICML). We’re backed by some of the top investors in grocery and tech including Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm), Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitch Fix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram), Food Retail Ventures, Maersk Growth, and Impact Engine.
We are building a vibrant, diverse, and inclusive team that embodies our company’s values: proactivity, kindness, candor, and humility. We aspire to continually grow as individuals and as an organization to live these values and realize our mission. We earnestly believe that Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by employing novel technology—and to have a ton of fun along the way.
Afresh provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, marital status, pregnancy or related condition, or any other basis protected by law"

Our mission
Aquabyte is on a mission to revolutionize the sustainability and efficiency of aquaculture. It is an audacious, and incredibly rewarding mission. By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the sea and preserve for generations to come.
We are a diverse, mission-driven team that is eager to work alongside kindred spirits. If this vision makes you smile, gives you goosebumps, or otherwise inspires you please get in touch.
Our product
We are currently focused on helping salmon farmers better understand their fish populations and make environmentally-sound decisions. Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect the health status, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application. As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.
Above all, Aquabyte is a customer-driven company. Our product development is dictated by the needs of fish farmers and we prioritize customer delight in everything we do. We are committed to build a global, collaborative team that creates value far beyond Silicon Valley.
The role
This is an exciting opportunity to be part of an emerging blue economy technology solution. Our product team is based in Norway and on the West Coast of the united states and as part of this amazing team you will help define product solutions that will have a massive impact on our future world. Most companies say this, but with Aquabyte it's true. You will be working on pioneering technology that no one else has defined and or built. This means that you need to be comfortable in a startup environment where processes are not well defined and where much of your job is to wrangle abstract concepts and make them into tangible items of true value. You should have a passion for technology and deep curiosity about the world around you and an innate ability to inspire teams to do the best work of their careers.

Experience with Vue.JS, docker, and PostgreSQL
Experience with containerization and service architectures
Experience with video and machine vision systems
Experience with scientific computing or laboratory automation

Culture

We think culture is something we build together, and should be used to motivate and cohere, rather than to exclude. If you are curious and excited about science and technology, enjoying working in a high autonomy, high accountability, and hands on environment, there's a good chance you'll be energized working at Methid. We have a strong goal-oriented and asynchronous culture, so cogent and pithy writers will flourish.

Bold Metrics Inc. (BMI) has created a suite of AI technologies that allows brands to accurately predict customer body measurements and relate them to garment specifications.

Along with garment sizing optimizations, the downstream experience becomes more customer-driven, leading to a significant reduction in returns and happier customers.

Product Designer,Sisu,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",4.0,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=efdc673bd36dbf50&fccid=ade8b9795a68d1d6&vjs=3,"At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.
Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, and past behaviors. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.
We’re looking for a thoughtful, data-savvy, and product-focused designer to join our growing team. In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to drive the visual and interaction identity of Sisu, as well as design and launch a wide range of product experiences from concept to implementation. You’ll have a big impact on our customers, our overall business, and Sisu’s future growth. For a sense of how we like to work with each other and approach problems, check out Sisu’s values.
What you'll accomplish:
Refine and implement Sisu’s look and feel in the product
Design and ship business-critical, user-centric, data-oriented product experiences
Create storyboards, wireframes, and prototypes to communicate your ideas to the team
Work cross-functionally with product, engineering, and sales to identify and prioritize customer needs
Elevate design thinking and culture at Sisu, as part of our small, but growing design team
What you'll need to be successful:
A strong sense of design fundamentals, including iconography, typography, color, and data visualization
Creativity, persistence, and inquisitiveness about analytics, BI, and enterprise data, and the desire to help businesses solve problems in new ways
A track record of designing and building rich, accessible desktop experiences
Ability to design and iterate quickly and efficiently in a dynamic setting
Comfort tackling ambiguous problem spaces and ability to bring clarity through problem definition, scoping, and prioritization for design
Prior experience conducting customer research of any type and ability to synthesize qualitative feedback with data to guide design decisions
Experience teaming up with engineers and designers to build and ship products
Familiarity with design tools, such as Figma, Sketch, and Principle
Nice to have:
Prior experience building enterprise or data-oriented products
Prior experience with data visualization
For a product designer, there’s no better environment to advance your career, develop your skills, and make an impact along the way. As you mature in this role, you’ll have the chance to work with global leaders, learn from industry mavericks, and help build an amazing, eclectic, and supportive organization.
Sisu is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status."

Scientist,Spring Discovery,"San Carlos, CA 94070+1 location",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=9605b36f82783d68&fccid=10ff6404a90f469b&vjs=3,"Spring is accelerating the discovery of therapies for aging and its related diseases. A tight integration of biology and machine learning is at our core, and we're building a rare team of scientists and computational folks that work together closely, fighting disease.

Impact
Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.


Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Yes, you belong
We are building a cross-functional team. We don't expect you to have a background in machine learning, just as we don't expect our computational folks to be expert biologists. We do expect our teams to work respectfully and closely, learning together every day.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.

About you
Record of past successes. You have a track record of successful execution of multiple scientific projects, ideally in both industry and academia.
Education. PhD (or similar experience) in aging biology, cell biology, genetics, or related fields.
Familiarity w/ microscopy and cell culture. Meaningful experience with both fluorescence microscopy and cell culture work.
Open-minded and collaborative. You're excited to work closely with experts in a different field (machine learning), learn from each other, and incorporate brand new approaches into your expertise.
Broad proficiency. You've shown proficiency in a wide range of in vitro and in vivo research approaches.
Tends towards ownership. You do anything necessary to solve the problem at hand.
Maturity in face of ambiguity. You help define questions instead of just answering them. You work to resolve ambiguity — and you're comfortable making decisions when it remains.
Crisp communicator. You excel at crisp, concise written or spoken communication. You love learning and teaching others in a cross-functional team (we're biologists, computational folks, and more).
Driven by impact. You're most motivated when working on a problem of important consequence, no matter what's necessary to do so.


Nice to have
2+ years of industry or post-PhD experience
High throughput screening experience
Experience on teams that've successfully advanced research to clinic


Benefits
Competitive salary and equity in a growing, well-funded startup
Excellent medical, dental, and vision coverage
Generous vacation policy
Healthy feedback-focused environment — leadership will have high expectations, regularly share constructive feedback, expect you to grow, and welcome receiving feedback from you


A unique moment
We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

And at the same time, we're just getting started. You're joining a team that has the funding needed to be ambitious while still early enough to help define our culture, choices, and success. Our expectations of you — and of ourselves — are high.

Team members can work primarily remotely. Starting in 2022, teams will meet in person every quarter in one of Grammarly’s hubs, currently in San Francisco, Vancouver, New York, and Kyiv. To ensure that teams are able to overlap in their working hours and to meet face-to-face when needed, all team members need to live within three time zones of their direct team.
Grammarly team members who will be collaborating at our San Francisco hub must be based in the United States.

The opportunity

Grammarly empowers people to thrive and connect, whenever and wherever they communicate. Every day, 30 million people and 30,000 teams around the world use our AI-powered writing assistant. All of this begins with our team collaborating in a values-driven and learning-oriented environment.

To achieve our ambitious goals, we’re looking for an experienced Technical Program Manager to join our User Intelligence group, whose work directly impacts millions of users. This group is made up of curious life-long learners who get excited about solving novel technical challenges at scale. The task of the User Intelligence team is to explore and validate product hypotheses and work across multiple teams: machine learning, applied research scientists, data science, growth, interfaces, and many more.

As the company grows, the amount of large cross-functional projects grows with it, demanding a dedicated Technical Program Manager to oversee this new collaboration and coordination.

In this role, you will:

Work through ambiguity, leading intelligence programs across multiple teams at Grammarly.
Identify opportunities, requirements, and risks that are associated with intelligence programs; define milestones and success criteria; and manage schedules.
Effectively communicate the above, both to the team and to leadership.
Develop and maintain scalable processes and assist with resource allocation.
Ensure priorities are aligned across all relevant teams and take steps to remove roadblocks to this alignment.
Take a holistic view across the greater intelligence organization, identifying points to improve collaboration/reuse and reduce redundancy.
Exercise technical judgment in evaluating projects and their potential solutions.
We’re looking for someone who
Embodies our EAGER values—is ethical, adaptable, gritty, empathetic, and remarkable.
Has at least 5 years of professional work experience with customer-facing products.
Is driven to proactively identify issues, risks, and opportunities.
Applies their technical expertise to care about the details without losing sight of the bigger picture.
Communicates effectively with their peers, executives, and independent contributors.
Support for you, professionally and personally
Professional growth: We hire people we trust, and we give team members autonomy to do their best work. We also support professional development with training, coaching, and regular feedback.
A connected team: Grammarly builds a product that helps people connect, and we apply this mindset to our own team. We have a highly collaborative culture supported by our EAGER values. We also take time to celebrate our colleagues and accomplishments with global, local, and team-specific events and programs.
Comprehensive benefits: Grammarly offers all team members competitive pay along with a benefits package that includes superior health care. We also offer support to set up a home office, ample and defined time off, gym and recreation stipends, admission discounts, and more.

Faire is an online wholesale marketplace built on the belief that the future is local — there are over 2 million independent retailers in North America and Europe doing more than $2 trillion in revenue. At Faire, we're using the power of tech, data, and machine learning to connect this thriving community of entrepreneurs across the globe. Picture your favorite boutique in town — we help them discover the best products from around the world to sell in their stores. With the right tools and insights, we believe that we can level the playing field so that small businesses everywhere can compete with these big box and e-commerce giants.

By supporting the growth of independent businesses, Faire is driving positive economic impact in local communities, globally. We're looking for smart, resourceful and passionate people to join us as we power the shop local movement. If you believe in community, come join ours.
About this role

As one of our earliest Content Designers at Faire, you'll join a tight-knit, collaborative design team that cares deeply about creating beautiful and intuitive experiences for our customers. In this role, you'll help shape Faire's brand voice from within our product interfaces, writing product narratives and developing content frameworks that balance personality and delight with usability. Working with team members across design, engineering, product, and marketing, you'll strive to understand our business goals and customers' challenges to craft elegant flows that help people successfully engage with our product and move through our products with confidence.

We're looking for design-minded writers and content strategists who care about getting to know our customers, about the nuances of language and tone, and about the role of narrative in UX and product design.

We're looking for candidates open to working in San Francisco, CA, Los Angeles, CA, New York City, NY, Atlanta, GA, Toronto, ON, Kitchener, ON or remotely.

What you'll do

Drive content design work on a core pillar of our product, partnering with a team of designers, engineers, and product managers as the team's content strategy expert
Own UX writing for a set of features, considering everything from component copy to entire workflows and information architecture
Champion the voice of Faire in our products
Participate in and/or lead user interviews and research to better understand customer motivations, language, and needs
Contribute strategic thinking to our style guide and design system, as well as our product features and roadmap
Jump into design tools as needed; previous experience with Figma, Whimsical or similar tools (or a strong willingness to learn) is great

What we're looking for

Experience shipping product

You've worked with designers, engineers, and PMs to take a feature from initial concept to live code. You know how to roll up your sleeves and dig in on content design needs, whether it's rethinking information architecture, reducing friction in a flow, or finding the right balance of in-product education and getting out of the user's way. You can speak the language of interaction design and have solid product intuition, and you're ready to advocate for cohesive content experiences.

A knack for simplifying

Whether it's turning a run-on into a 3-word phrase or defining the ""so what"" of a new feature, you're a master simplifier. You help teams fight the urge to over-explain by partnering with design to create experiences that are deceptively simple and intuitive.

A love for words

You understand the power of a perfectly timed pun. You know how to use punctuation to add rhythm, humor, or weight to a sentence. You have an opinion about em-dashes. Writing is your craft, and you find ways to infuse delight into the right moments to help bring our brand to life.

Qualifications

5+ years in a UX writing or product design role. If you have other writing or UX experience that you think translates to this role well, we'd love to see your stuff, too.
Great communication & leadership skills. You should be able to present your decisions and processes clearly and confidently, regardless of audience.
A collaborative approach. You're a great partner to other designers and your cross-functional teammates.
A growth mindset. You're open and receptive to feedback, and can adapt quickly in a fast-paced environment.
A sense of humor. We spend a lot of time together—even if that's on Zoom these days. Sharing gifs and laughing over lunch keeps our team energized and inspired.

We value candidates that bring a range of experience from different industries and a variety of creative influences. If you're a maker or retailer yourself and can bring first-hand experience and empathy for the small business and entrepreneurial journey, tell us your story!

Senior Data Scientist,Span.IO,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=771e98e4afeeb6ff&fccid=764e5e1f9b11dc9a&vjs=3,"The Mission

The electrical grid was built to carry electricity unidirectionally from central fossil fuel plants to end consumers. As we transition to a renewable future built from rooftop solar and community storage, the grid itself needs an overhaul. Span's goal is to re-invent the grid from a clean slate to enable that transition, envisioning a grid made of distributed control systems and software as much as copper wires.

To accomplish this, we are upgrading the breaker panel — the humble box sitting at the center of every building's electrical wiring — to monitor, control, and make decisions about energy. This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.

Span's unique commitment to clean-slate ""right architecture"" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.

The Role

We aim to establish the Span panel as the center of home energy and the backbone of the renewable distributed grid. Analytics and ML are essential tools to develop features for the smart, green, energy-efficient home of the future. Span's unique ability to monitor and control individual circuits opens up a new avenue for proactive whole-home management and equipment failure detection. As Senior Data Scientist, you will leverage your deep understanding of ML, modeling, and statistics to solve problems including anomaly detection, time series forecasting, and event prediction with the goal to optimally manage whole-home energy consumption, deliver meaningful insights to the customer, and notify them about a potential failure of equipment or hazards in their home. You'll be involved through the entire development process, from the acquisition of all additional third-party data, the initial design to remote monitoring in the field.

Responsibilities

Lead the development of ML algorithms from the ground up which includes:

Gain knowledge in the relevant domain (e.g.common failure modes of appliances)

Feature engineering

Prototype new algorithms

Benchmark performance across large scale datasets

Use your experience with different machine learning frameworks to identify suitable tools for integration in Span's software platform

Integrate developed algorithms in our production code base with robust test coverage

Work with the firmware and software teams to design Span's edge model deployment framework; pick which ML framework Span should adopt

Proactively identify opportunities within Span that can benefit from data science analysis

Use fleet data to monitor algorithms in the field

Note: We're a startup, so while this list is broad, it's still just a start; you'll end up wearing many hats during your time at Span.

About You
Required Qualifications

Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, or a closely related field

4+ years' of professional experience with developing and implementing machine learning models to production

4+ years of Data Scientist experience

Deep understanding machine learning algorithms (anomaly/outlier detection in time series data, time series forecasting, clustering algorithms, probabilistic models)

Advanced Python skills, as well as familiarity with pandas and scikit-learn

Software design experience and ability to write clean, maintainable, and shippable production code

We value open communication, teamwork, and a make-it-happen attitude - no job is too big or too small. We strive to make change by imagining what the future could be and building a product to complete that vision. We are looking to grow our team with talented people who are on the same mission to shape the future of energy.

Working at Span, you can expect:

Competitive compensation at a well-funded, venture-backed company

Comprehensive benefits including a choice of medical plans; dental, vision, life and disability insurance

A sunny, airy office located close to BART and Caltrain public transit

Regular team lunches, brown bag learning opportunities, board games nights, and other opportunities to connect with teammates - in-person and now virtually

Equity grants at a quickly-growing startup

Flexible hours and vacation time - we simultaneously work hard and make space for the important stuff

To be a part of a team and culture that is hard-working, has a good sense of humor, values collaboration, and is just a little bit nerdy

Machine learning and data science are at our core, and we're building a rare computational team that works closely with our biologists, together fighting disease.

Impact
Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Yes, you belong
We are building a cross-functional team. We don't expect you to have a background in biology, just as we don't expect our biologists to be experts in ML. We do expect our teams to work respectfully and closely, learning together every day.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.

About you

Love answering questions that help others. You get energy being faced with a series of questions that are important for others’ work and driving quickly towards answers that help them.
Tends towards ownership. You’re able to lead an analysis from the earliest stages of acquiring data all the way through to reaching conclusions from that data.
Crisp communicator. You excel at crisp, concise written or spoken communication. You love learning and teaching others in a cross-functional team (we're biologists, computational folks, and more).
Driven by impact. You're most motivated when working on a problem of important consequence, no matter what's necessary to do so.


Nice to have

Biological data experience. You bring familiarity with the pitfalls and analytical techniques typically encountered with large biological datasets.
Deep learning intuition. You bring intuition about datasets and experiment structures for deep learning from personal experience.
Scientific background. You have cultural familiarity with scientists and labs from personal experience. You know the language of scientists as well as that of the technical world.

Benefits
Competitive salary and equity in a growing, well-funded startup
Excellent medical, dental, and vision coverage
Generous vacation policy
Healthy feedback-focused environment — leadership will have high expectations, regularly share constructive feedback, expect you to grow, and welcome receiving feedback from you


A unique moment
We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

And at the same time, we're just getting started. You're joining a team that has the funding needed to be ambitious while still early enough to help define our culture, choices, and success. Our expectations of you — and of ourselves — are high.

The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As organisations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a black box they can't understand. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered view of the Internet, cloud and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers work together to identify problems before it impacts revenue, damages brand reputation, or halts employee productivity.

In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within Cisco's Network Services Business Group, and is a foundational component of Cisco's growing Observability business.

What You'll Do

ThousandEyes Systems and Tools Support Engineers support Identity management and SAAS application management, including renewals and required software tracking for applications and tools that are shared across the specific internal ThousandEyes organization.

In this role, you will support a rapidly growing organization and ensure ThousandEyes' team to function smoothly. We believe that our engineers are key to enabling our employees to have friction-free workflows and be productive.

We're looking for talented engineers with a background in internal operations, service desk, IT, and Saas software IT support. You must be willing to work closely with employees at ThousandEyes. This role does not require end-user Mac or PC tech support - that's handled by Cisco IT!

Apply for this role if you:

Are a fast learner
Believe in software automation
Can script in at least 1 language
Have exceptional troubleshooting skills
Have superb customer service aptitude with exceptional written and verbal communication skills
Understand network fundamentals (TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, MAC addresses, IP packets, DNS, VoIP, etc.)

Bonus points if you have experience with or are knowledgeable about Okta, Active Directory, Single Sign On / SAML, or Cisco / Meraki.

Cisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis. Cisco will consider for employment, on a case by case basis, qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.

We Are Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here's how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we're ""old"" (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we're also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can't put us in a box!

But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don't care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That's cool."

Machine Learning Engineer,Afresh,"San Francisco, CA+1 location",None,None,Posted29 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=150d624dfdc7fb25&fccid=cd4725921f2c98aa&vjs=3,"Afresh is on a mission to reduce food waste and increase access to nutritious food globally by transforming the fresh food supply chain. Our solution is currently deployed in hundreds of grocery stores across the United States and is on track to reduce 30 million pounds of food waste per year with our existing customers alone. By 2021, we're aiming to reduce food waste by a quarter billion pounds per year.

The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day; fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem! We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies.

You will be working on pushing the boundaries of our system's performance on product categories we're already live in, as well as expanding our product to entirely new categories. You will be responsible for implementing new systems end-to-end, including working with product teams to define the business needs of a solution, reviewing research papers and implementing novel ideas, and scaling up experiments to generate predictions and decisions on millions of items every day. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.
What you will do:
In your first 3 months, you will experiment with new features, train and validate new models, and push updates to all of our customers. You will build a strong understanding of perishable inventory control, time series forecasting, and simulation techniques.
By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously tested algorithmic or engineering improvements to our core models, featurization, or automatic training and experimentation systems.
By the end of your first year, you will have implemented new modeling techniques, expanded our product offering to new categories with novel algorithms, and scaled your solution to our entire customer base.
We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every day, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof. This is not an analytics team.
What skills or experience do you need?
4+ years of professional software development experience with advanced machine learning or statistical and numerical optimization methods.
You have repeatedly and successfully taken complex research ideas from experiment to production, and you write high-quality and high-performance code that lives outside of experiments.
Familiarity with forecasting techniques, time series analysis, and large-scale stochastic optimization is a plus.
A graduate degree in operations research, computer science, electrical engineering, statistics, or similar quantitative field is a plus.

Founded in 2017, Afresh is the first A.I.-powered fresh food optimization platform for grocery chains. We have partnered with several large grocers representing hundreds of stores and >$10B in revenue. Our cutting-edge AI research has been published in top journals (e.g., ICML). We’re backed by some of the top investors in grocery and tech including Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm), Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitch Fix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram), Food Retail Ventures, Maersk Growth, and Impact Engine.
We are building a vibrant, diverse, and inclusive team that embodies our company’s values: proactivity, kindness, candor, and humility. We aspire to continually grow as individuals and as an organization to live these values and realize our mission. We earnestly believe that Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by employing novel technology—and to have a ton of fun along the way.
Afresh provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, marital status, pregnancy or related condition, or any other basis protected by law"

Staff Android Engineer,Quizlet,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=d5ce9f9aacfb2250&fccid=30aa2c54dfe7480c&vjs=3,"About Quizlet:
Inspired by our belief that anyone can learn anything and powered by our own curiosity, we build the smartest tools we can imagine to help students learn.
Quizlet is the popular, global learning platform and app that millions of students, teachers and everyday people use to study any subject imaginable for school, work or as part of their personal interests - including two-thirds of high school students and half of all college students in the US. Combining cognitive science and machine learning, Quizlet guides students through adaptive study activities to confidently reach their learning goals. We’re on track to become the undisputed leader in user-generated learning content and engagement, at the scale of YouTube.
Valued at $1 billion, Quizlet has raised over $60 million in venture capital from investors including Icon Ventures, Union Square Ventures, General Atlantic, Costanoa Ventures, Owl Ventures, and Altos Ventures.
To serve our global community of learners, our teams tackle lofty technical challenges and design for use cases across cultures and languages. We work hard, act like owners, and collaborate every chance we get. We’re energized by the potential to power more learners through multiple approaches and various tools.
With offices in major cities around the world and ambitious plans for expansion, we remain grounded in our commitment to our mission of helping people learn. We’re looking for new team members who crave a challenge and want to help us continue amplifying our impact.
About the Team:
The Android team is focused on building the best app to help people learn on their Android devices. The team works with other product teams across the organization to ensure we’re building mobile-first experiences that allow students to get the most out of Quizlet on their Android phones and tablets.
We collaborate with Product Managers, Designers, Data Analysts, iOS Engineers, and Web Engineers from other teams to ensure their vision aligns with the way Android does things.
As a platform team, we ensure the Android application is robust, defect-free, and fast. Besides implementing new features, we also ensure our tech-debt is kept in check, and plan to refactor to modernize the older parts of our codebase.
About the Role:
As a member on the Android team, an average day likely starts by working on what's the highest priority for your current area of focus. We follow the Kanban process, so you then join the rest of the team at 10 AM Pacific to walk the board and help communicate status on any of your stories that are still in-progress, highlighting anything that might be getting in your way or in the way of the team.
Some days, you’ll meet with the team to plan and discuss what goals the team can accomplish in the next couple of weeks and what will need to be done to accomplish them. Similarly, after every 2 weeks, you’ll meet for a team retrospective to discuss what has gone well and what could be improved in our development process.
Typically, the team aims to schedule meetings between 10 am and 2 pm, so that you have blocks of uninterrupted time in the morning and the afternoon to focus. Though Wednesdays are our no-meetings day, so you can expect to have a whole day to really push work forward!
During the uninterrupted time, typically you get deep into coding and building the things you researched and estimated. Another good use of this time is to set up a pair-programming session with another engineer that has experience in the codebase you’re working on, or that wishes to learn more about that part of the codebase.
You can also use that time to research a project and identify what will need to be groomed with the product manager, or what questions you need to ask the designer, or how does the project need to be structured to work with our data along a data scientist, or what specific events will the data analyst need to answer our experiment hypothesis.
This research allows you to understand the product requirements and create an engineering plan to later estimate with a larger group of Android engineers to ensure your approach is sound and others are familiar with your decisions, and ultimately to help you estimate the work so it can be scheduled at a better time. Once you code the feature and build the tests to ensure it works as designed, you create a pull request where you can help other engineers learn how you built the new feature or fixed a defect, and get feedback to grow as a developer.
Outside the team process and meetings, the Android team also meets biweekly and discusses upcoming projects and progress being made on the platform from the other teams with Android engineers.


In this role, you will:
Collaborate with Android engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists, and other engineers to plan, develop, test, release features
Contribute and extend our Kotlin multi-platform codebase to share logic and features across our iOS and Web platforms
Refactor Java and Kotlin based legacy code to modernize and improve the developer experience
Lead and/or contribute to projects that improve Quizlet’s Learning Assistant and study modes
Contribute, propose, and lead Android platform investment projects each quarter that aim to improve the productivity of Android engineers as well as the quality of the codebase
What you bring to the table:
6+ years of experience building Android mobile applications
Excellent written and oral communication skills
Experience leading projects
Proficiency with Kotlin and/or Java
Experience with CS fundamentals, software design patterns, and data structures
Proficiency writing unit tests and testable code
Enjoy collaborating with a cross-disciplinary team to solve problems through experimentation
Experience building high-quality native apps, ideally published on Google Play
Experience using popular Android libraries for simplifying or improving network, database, and UI components
Excitement about the impact your work could have on the lives of students and teachers around the world every day
Bonus points if you:
Teach, tutor, or mentor others at work or outside of work
Advocate architecture improvements to multidisciplinary stakeholders
Look for ways to add automated unit and integration tests using JUnit, Espresso, or Robolectric
Have contributed or improved continuous integration processes with systems like CircleCI or Jenkins
Gained proficiency with RxJava, Dependency Injection, Retrofit, MVVM, OrmLite/Room
Keep yourself up to date with the latest Android ecosystem news and libraries
Benefits & Perks:
Employees are eligible to participate in the Quizlet stock option program
Collaborate with your manager and team to create a schedule that ensures a high level of productivity (creating that ideal work/life balance)
We offer 20 days of paid vacation (and we expect you to take them!)
Comprehensive health coverage (Anthem, Kaiser), HSA, FSA, dental and vision (Guardian), competitive salary, 401(k), and equity
Other perks include: Wellness stipend, pet insurance offerings, annual learning and development stipend, commuter subsidy, and 40 hours of annual paid time off to participate in volunteer programs of choice
In addition, we offer access to mental health resources, fertility education, fertility preservation, IVF, genetic testing, surrogacy, adoption, and more
We strive to make everyone feel comfortable and welcome!
We work to create a holistic interview process, where both Quizlet and candidates have an opportunity to view what it would be like to work together, in exploring a mutually beneficial partnership.
We provide a transparent setting, that gives a comprehensive view of who we are!
In Closing:
We hope you are excited about everything you read so far. We highly encourage you to apply for this position, even if you feel you do not meet all the requirements. Quizlet is always looking for amazing folks that believe in our mission and can contribute to our team in various ways - not merely candidates that fit a certain mold.
We have a bias for action, take initiative, and hustle to deliver results. We make informed decisions whenever possible but are unafraid to take calculated risks on great ideas to promote learning. We embrace challenges and see effort as the path to mastery. We’re constantly seeking opportunities to learn and we embrace curiosity. Quality matters at Quizlet, and we hold the bar high on everything we do.

We treat each other with honesty and respect, encourage vigorous debate, and seek critical feedback. We value diversity, humility, transparency, and collaboration as the best paths to our success — as individuals, as a team, and as a company.
Quizlet’s success as an online learning community depends on a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We are actively working to build a team that is representative of the diverse communities we serve, and an open, inclusive work environment where all employees can thrive. As an equal opportunity employer and a tech company committed to societal change, we welcome applicants from all backgrounds. Women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, individuals with disabilities, and veterans are strongly encouraged to apply. Come join us!

Please do not forward unsolicited agency resumes to our website or to any Quizlet employee. Quizlet will not pay fees to any third-party agency or firm nor will it be responsible for any agency fees associated with unsolicited resumes.

The Postdoc would join an exciting new project investigating emissions of criteria pollutants from locomotive and port craft operations and air toxics from point, line, and areal sources, and their impacts on daily respiratory disease symptoms in Southern California. Funded by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), collaborators from the University of California, Berkeley (PI Dr. Jason Su and key investigator Dr. John Balmes) and ResMed (PI Dr. Meredith Barrett) will work collaboratively to investigate 1) the temporal and spatial patterns of inhaled medication use, collected by digital sensors, 2) the spatiotemporal variations of criteria pollutants and air toxics across Southern California, and 3) associations of inhaled medication use with criteria pollutants and air toxics. Daily land-use regression models will be developed through incorporating a comprehensive data source including remote sensing data, land use and land cover data, traffic and pollen data, criteria air pollutants, trace metals, stationary sources of emissions, highway pavement conditions data, and hourly and daily weather data. Dispersion modeling techniques including STILT modeling will be applied to identify sources of contributions of locomotive and port craft operations on exposure levels experienced by vulnerable communities in Southern California.

In health outcome modeling, both traditional environmental epidemiology models (e.g., linear mixed models) and advanced machine learning models (e.g., random forest models) will be used in the modeling process and compared with prediction powers. The results of this project will help CARB characterize the health effects of its regulatory programs, and help identify disproportionately exposed communities and their related sources. More importantly, it will also provide the information needed to include respiratory disease symptoms as a new endpoint for CARB's health analyses in its regulatory processes.

The Postdoctoral Scholar would also contribute to a number of technical areas related to air pollution science, exposure science, epidemiology, and environmental health. Examples of technical areas where highly qualified candidates might contribute include:

Knowledge in acquiring and processing land use, land cover, weather, and traffic data from various sources for use in land-use regression model development;
Analyzing daily and hourly traffic data from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Performance Measurement System (PeMS);
Linking traffic or other data to temporal environmental data layers through R or Python programming;
Developing daily land-use regression models through R or Python programming;
Carrying out random forest modeling, implementing deletion/substitution/addition algorithms, or performing mixed-effects modeling;
Analyzing respiratory symptom data through R or Python programming;
Identifying time and location of environmental triggers;
Modeling environmental triggers of respiratory symptoms through both traditional linear mixed models and machine learning techniques, such as random forest modeling techniques.

Postdoctoral Scholars are exclusively represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) local (5810).

Headquarters: San Francisco Bay Area

About Us
We invented a new type of credit card backed by assets (secured by equity in your home, cars, & other assets), enabling us to offer mind-bendingly low APRs to consumers. Our first product is the world’s lowest APR credit card. Come invent & change the world with us.
Who are we?
We are a well capitalized (over 60MM in equity funding) team of technology (Microsoft, Facebook), and finance (Square, Discover, CapitalOne, and Goldman) executives with top tier investors - Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, Max Levchin, NYCA, Sequoia, etc.
Our team includes people who have built
Financial products (Square/CashApp, the earliest CapitalOne credit cards)
Consumer products (Internet.org, Xbox)
Technology infrastructure (Visual Studio, Windows & Azure, helped design the C++ & C# languages)
Mathematics & science infrastructure (computational research at NASA’s JPL).
We are missionaries that like to work hard on important problems - and build products that become infrastructure for society. We believe that using technology to lower the cost of capital for consumers is one of these problems - and if we can do it, it could have a big impact on a lot of people’s lives.
Our philosophy
We are a technology company at heart - and we seek to invent & advance the state of the art to build insanely great consumer financial products - starting with the world’s first home-equity backed credit card.
We like to deeply understand the nuances & excruciating details of the systems we are building on top of - whether it be legal frameworks & regs, or APIs and 3rd party data-providers. No work is beneath any of us - from the CEO to our compliance lead - we get excited to audit our database to check each cell to ensure that they are correct and to pick up customer support calls.
We believe inventing great products happens at the intersection of extremely deep detailed domain knowledge & a very lateral thought process. We don’t like to invent for the sake of it - we do it when we think we can make something significantly better.
We value being pragmatic, rational, fast, minimalist, detailed oriented, and obsessively customer-centric.

Senior Backend Developer,Octopus Energy,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=1f09bf883c832b45&fccid=94f2a41501d80d3d&vjs=3,"Welcome to the future of energy
We’re a leading energy technology company providing a better experience for our customers through transparency, honesty and simplicity. Better for the planet, through real long-term investment in renewable generation and a low CO2 future and better for our customer’s wallets with fair and affordable plans. Through our proprietary platform and custom-built stack, cloud-based billing, and sophisticated use of data science, we’re revolutionizing what’s possible in energy. We’re transforming the way people interact with their energy company, by making it approachable, easy-to-understand, and most importantly, 100% renewable. We’ve distinguished ourselves by being named 2020’s Energy Provider of the Year, which highlights our commitment to exceptional customer service.
We’ve just hopped across the pond in the US and are making big strides in Texas...but that’s only the beginning. Come join our rapidly growing team as we continue to break barriers in energy.



Our team
We follow a Kanban-like approach, using Google docs, BaseCamp, and Asana to specify and manage work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Loggly, Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production.
Engineering standards are high. We pair program, thoroughly review and test code before it deploys, and maintain fast, high-value test suites. We have weekly tech talks, monthly blitz-days (eg sharpening our internal tools, upgrading dependencies) and can often be found at tech meet-ups and conferences.
Our coding conventions are open-source and we maintain a tech blog.
Octopus is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills.
Our technology
On the server-side, we mainly use Python. Most of our websites are powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework. We also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting, plus Celery, RabbitMQ, SQS and Airflow for background processing.
We use AWS heavily, employing most of the ""Hashistack"" (eg Packer, Consul, Terraform) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, Django, ELB health checks and continuous delivery.
Client-side, we use React, Redux and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React Native.
What you'll do
Take ownership of the challenges presented. Octopus believes that senior developers are capable of delivering on larger projects in a sustainable manner and do so while encouraging others to participate in the effort through documentation and best practices.
We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The US energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's a lot of domain modeling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.
We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.
There's a great opportunity for disruption in the US energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a ""tracker"" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff
You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.
What you'll have
At least 5 years of professional experience
The desire to to lead and mentor less experienced developers
General interest in technology and problem-solving; Diligent and thoughtful
Excellent communication skills
Python
Domain modelling
HTTP and REST APIs
Writing robust and fault-tolerant software
Celery and async processing
Postgres
Legally able to work within the USA
Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:
Django
Django REST Framework
AWS
Terraform, Packer, Consul
React and Redux
Professional understanding of the US energy domain
Why else you'll love us
Great medical, dental, and vision insurance options including FSAs
Unlimited paid time off — we know working hard means also being able to recharge as needed, we trust our employees to get the work done and take the time they need..
401(k) plan with employer match:
Parental leave. Biological, adoptive and foster parents are all eligible.
Pre-tax commuter benefits .
Flexible working environment: you need to shift around your schedule? You do you, we genuinely believe in work/life balance.
Equity Options: every Octopus employee owns part of the business. We’re a team, working together towards huge goals. Every person is crucial to our success, you should be rewarded as such.
Modern office or co-working spaces depending on location.
If this all sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you.

At Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our commitment is to provide equal opportunities, a diverse and inclusive work environment, and fairness for everyone. You are welcome to apply no matter your race, gender identity, sexuality, age, family or civil status, disability, religion, or ethnicity."

At GSK we see a world in which advanced applications of machine learning and AI will allow us to develop novel therapies to existing diseases and to quickly respond to emerging or changing diseases with personalized drugs, driving better outcomes at reduced cost with fewer side effects. It is an ambitious vision that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of machine learning and AI. If that excites you, we'd love to chat.
The AIML Sequence Learning Team applies machine learning and AI methods to DNA and RNA sequence data from large-scale human genetic, functional genomic and single cell experiments. DNA sequence variations are linked to disease via changes in the nature and abundance of protein and RNA gene products. The Sequence Learning group builds models directly from DNA/RNA sequence in addition to other data sources such as chromatin state. Models that operate on a sequence level can infer changes in protein/RNA states and the associated cellular function from sequence alone. This is an exciting methodological advance at the intersection of NLP inspired language models applied to biological data.

Software Engineer - Core Engine Internals,Sisu,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",4.0,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=344733939e8e7637&fccid=ade8b9795a68d1d6&vjs=3,"At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.
Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, and past behaviors. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.
As a Core Engine Internals Engineer, you'll help us shape the future of the Sisu Engine - a parallel, distributed, cloud-native dataflow engine for high performance ML model execution, written in Rust. We're looking for database internals engineers experienced with query planning and optimization, access methods, and data layout. You'll play a critical role in helping us advance the performance and efficiency of our system—both with low-level optimizations, such as honing concurrency and reducing memory allocations, as well as high-level architecture, such as maximizing distributed computing throughput and scheduling work fairly. Your contributions to the speed and scalability of our system will directly go into one of the key differentiators for our product against the status quo. Success in this area will be the foundation on which future Sisu features depend.
Responsibilities
Design, engineer, and operate Sisu's scalable parallel data processing engine, including distributed query processing, columnar execution, and streaming updates
Develop novel and scalable systems combining hardware-accelerated data processing with machine learning and statistical hypothesis testing
Technical leadership
Shape the engineering culture through mentorship
Build out our data plane
Implement new analyses in our performance-critical data processing engine
Optimize and scale data ingest and workload distribution
Actively participate in customer POCs to optimize customer experience and adoption.
Work collaboratively with multiple departments such as Sales, Marketing, and G&A.
Key Qualifications
A passion for database systems, storage systems, distributed systems, and/or performance optimization
Substantial experience building production-grade data-intensive systems, especially database internals and/or large-scale parallel data processing systems internals
Substantial experience in low-level systems programming, including but not limited to SIMD vectorization, memory management, and general mechanical sympathy
Strong understanding of data-related CS fundamentals including distributed systems and distributed computing, fault tolerance and consensus protocols, and query optimization
Strong interest in or production experience writing large-scale systems in Rust

And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can’t put us in a box!
But ""Digital Transformation"" is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

We can provide you with space outside of your home to work if you need to (e.g. co-working offices), or help get your home to be more accommodating to work.
We do not trap people in front of their screens or lock them in overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours and ample vacation time. See our employee handbook here.

Applied Scientist,Afresh,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted29 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=9e8950e06a36982c&fccid=cd4725921f2c98aa&vjs=3,"Afresh is on a mission to reduce food waste and increase access to nutritious food globally by transforming the fresh food supply chain. Our solution is currently deployed in hundreds of grocery stores across the United States and is on track to reduce 30 million pounds of food waste per year with our existing customers alone. By 2021, we're aiming to reduce food waste by a quarter billion pounds per year.

The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day. Fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem. We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies.

We are looking for an Applied Scientist to lead the R&D work at Afresh. You will take your existing knowledge of forecasting, simulation, and stochastic optimization and apply it to the challenging and important problem of perishable inventory control. You will research, implement, and rigorously validate improvements to our core replenishment system. This will include modeling consumer demand, item-level perishability, and complex multi-echelon supply chains. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.
What you will do:
You will work on improving the core models of our system: demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and simulation. You will also lead research development for new product and business challenges. You will model the complex problems of inventory decay, promotions, price elasticity, and inventory uncertainty, and implement solutions to multi-stage and multi-echelon inventory optimization problems.
In your first 3 months, you will acquire an encyclopedic knowledge of perishable inventory control and Afresh's core decision making problem. You will gain proficiency in our data manipulation, transformation, and simulation tools, and you'll test an experimental improvement to our demand forecasting, ordering, or simulation models.
By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously validated an improvement to our core modeling system.
By the end of your first year, you will have led the implementation of fundamental changes to our core system and led research into new product areas (warehouse level replenishment, production planning).
We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every week, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof. This is not an analytics team.
What skills and experience do you need?
5+ years of industrial or academic experience building systems that deal with large-scale decision making under uncertainty. Some possible prior research areas are inventory optimization, supply chain management, network optimization, forecasting, game theory, decision analysis, or stochastic and approximate dynamic programming.
Excellent communication and presentation skills. You should be able to explain complex mathematical ideas to product teams in plain English and easily translate business requirements into constrained optimization problems.
Ability to independently deliver high quality software implementations of your solutions in the Python data stack (numpy/torch/pandas/etc). Knowing Python before joining is not required.
PhD in Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related quantitative field

Founded in 2017, Afresh is the first A.I.-powered fresh food optimization platform for grocery chains. We have partnered with several large grocers representing hundreds of stores and >$10B in revenue. Our cutting-edge AI research has been published in top journals (e.g., ICML). We’re backed by some of the top investors in grocery and tech including Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm), Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitch Fix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram), Food Retail Ventures, Maersk Growth, and Impact Engine.
We are building a vibrant, diverse, and inclusive team that embodies our company’s values: proactivity, kindness, candor, and humility. We aspire to continually grow as individuals and as an organization to live these values and realize our mission. We earnestly believe that Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by employing novel technology—and to have a ton of fun along the way.

Office Manager,Spring Discovery,"San Carlos, CA 94070",None,None,Posted19 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=6ab36e63c8a89db9&fccid=10ff6404a90f469b&vjs=3,"tl;dr

Spring is accelerating the discovery of therapies for aging and its related diseases. A tight integration of biology and machine learning is at our core, and we're building a rare team of scientists and computational folks working together to accelerate our innovative approach to modeling the biology of aging (in vitro and in vivo) and turning experimental data into therapeutic insight.

Impact

Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Back office support- support accounts payable, organization of contracts, billing, and compliance paperwork
Travel Logistics- support flights, hotels, transportation, dining, etc. planning for both our remote employees as well as job candidates

Our team

We are building an interdisciplinary team. We don't expect you to have a background in machine learning, just as we don't expect our computer scientists to be expert biologists. We do expect our teams to work closely and learn together day in and day out.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.

We’re on a mission to hire the very best and are committed to creating exceptional employee experiences where everyone is respected and has access to equal opportunity. We realize that new ideas can come from everywhere in the organization, and we know the next big idea could be yours!
The Opportunity
Machine Learning is a critical part of Adobe’s Cloud offering. Adobe Clouds enable customers to build and manage digital content, such as assets, composites, 3D, documents etc., and digital experience and transformations.
Creative Cloud is focused on visual imagination and creation, and includes such well-known products as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Adobe Stock. Document Cloud is centered around the creation and management of textual documents, including Acrobat and Adobe Sign. Experience Cloud is the set of offerings for the large-scale enterprise, covering marketing, advertising, and analytics.
Adobe Sensei powers machine learning and artificial intelligence across all of these Adobe Cloud product lines. This platform enables thousands of applied researchers, millions of users, and billions of content pieces. The objective is to make machine learning offerings a world-class, leading-edge, differentiating product in Adobe Cloud ecosystem. We match the pace, innovation and excitement of a startup, backed by the resources and infrastructure of Adobe!
Data is critical piece of developing machine learning solutions. ML data can include the datasets that train algorithms, but also large-scale evaluation datasets which give insights into algorithm behavior that helps to refine and evolve ML products.
Training data – Adobe’s training datasets often contain digital art, photos, videos, text, or audio files, along with some type of additional knowledge data (user behaviors, annotations, manipulations) to enable meaningful machine learning. How do we build these datasets to maximize performance and accuracy for the customer? How do we ensure that our models are robust and unbiased?
Evaluation - How do we assess the quality of our algorithms and models? What is the ground truth we use to judge them? Where do they succeed and how do they fail? These problems are even more subtle in the complex, creative domains of Adobe products – for example, how should we judge the quality of similarity search, where a user finds new images with an image as the query?
We’re looking for data scientists to define, drive, and coordinate training data construction and model evaluation for the Applied Machine Learning team at Adobe. This will involve thinking hard about product quality, the role of machine learning in those products, and the capabilities of large-scale human-judgment tasks to support scalable solutions that generate the fuel for success of our AI/ML algorithms.
Responsibilities:
Work closely with product, research, and engineering leaders to understand ML applications and define success.
Interact with APIs to effectively sample raw data to optimize for ML training and evaluation.
Design tasks and guidelines for human judgment jobs to annotate images, videos, text, audio; and also to measure the performance of machine-learned and other advanced algorithms.
Help design A/B tests for our cloud offerings, and use human judgment vs. end-user A/B tests as appropriate
Create a winning culture built on collaboration and shared accomplishments- have fun along the way!
Qualifications:
BS or MS in a technical field (Computer Science, Physics, Math, Statistics) OR in a human-centered field such as Psychology, Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction.
Exposure to applied machine learning in an enterprise setting.
Proven experience in validation and evaluation of machine learned models.
Strong quantitative and analytical orientation. Experience in evaluation metrics, Python or R, JSON parsing, custom HTML for visualization.
Strong qualitative skillset. Experience in taxonomies, survey design.
Understanding of issues around ground truth and training/evaluation data for ML, including human judgment and A/B testing
Hands-on experience using third-party judgment services such as Figure 8, Appen, or Amazon Mechanical Turk.
At Adobe, you will be immersed in an exceptional work environment that is recognized throughout the world on Best Companies lists. You will also be surrounded by colleagues who are committed to helping each other grow through our unique Check-In approach where ongoing feedback flows freely.
If you’re looking to make an impact, Adobe's the place for you. Discover what our employees are saying about their career experiences on the Adobe Life blog and explore the meaningful benefits we offer.
Adobe is an equal opportunity employer. We welcome and encourage diversity in the workplace regardless of gender, race or color, ethnicity or national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or veteran status."

Machine Learning Engineer,Afresh,"San Francisco, CA+1 location",None,None,Posted29 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=150d624dfdc7fb25&fccid=cd4725921f2c98aa&vjs=3,"Afresh is on a mission to reduce food waste and increase access to nutritious food globally by transforming the fresh food supply chain. Our solution is currently deployed in hundreds of grocery stores across the United States and is on track to reduce 30 million pounds of food waste per year with our existing customers alone. By 2021, we're aiming to reduce food waste by a quarter billion pounds per year.

The Prediction, Optimization, and Planning (POP) team builds Afresh's core replenishment technology. Our models are directly responsible for ordering millions of dollars of fresh inventory across the world every day; fresh food ordering is an extremely complex high-dimensional decision-making problem! We face the complex challenges presented by decaying product, uncertain shelf lives, varying consumer demand, stochastic arrival times, extreme weather events, and tight performance constraints (to name a few). We tackle these problems with a mix of machine learning, large-scale simulation, and optimization technologies.

You will be working on pushing the boundaries of our system's performance on product categories we're already live in, as well as expanding our product to entirely new categories. You will be responsible for implementing new systems end-to-end, including working with product teams to define the business needs of a solution, reviewing research papers and implementing novel ideas, and scaling up experiments to generate predictions and decisions on millions of items every day. Your work will be visible from day one, will make a substantial impact on decreasing food waste, and will lead to fresher, healthier produce for millions of people across the world.
What you will do:
In your first 3 months, you will experiment with new features, train and validate new models, and push updates to all of our customers. You will build a strong understanding of perishable inventory control, time series forecasting, and simulation techniques.
By the end of your first 6 months, you will have proposed, implemented, and rigorously tested algorithmic or engineering improvements to our core models, featurization, or automatic training and experimentation systems.
By the end of your first year, you will have implemented new modeling techniques, expanded our product offering to new categories with novel algorithms, and scaled your solution to our entire customer base.
We need to make optimal ordering decisions for millions of items for weeks at a time, and our system must be fault-tolerant to an extreme. Our partners rely on our system to order millions of dollars of inventory every day, and so your code must be rigorously validated, tested, and bug-proof. This is not an analytics team.
What skills or experience do you need?
4+ years of professional software development experience with advanced machine learning or statistical and numerical optimization methods.
You have repeatedly and successfully taken complex research ideas from experiment to production, and you write high-quality and high-performance code that lives outside of experiments.
Familiarity with forecasting techniques, time series analysis, and large-scale stochastic optimization is a plus.
A graduate degree in operations research, computer science, electrical engineering, statistics, or similar quantitative field is a plus.

Founded in 2017, Afresh is the first A.I.-powered fresh food optimization platform for grocery chains. We have partnered with several large grocers representing hundreds of stores and >$10B in revenue. Our cutting-edge AI research has been published in top journals (e.g., ICML). We’re backed by some of the top investors in grocery and tech including Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm), Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitch Fix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram), Food Retail Ventures, Maersk Growth, and Impact Engine.
We are building a vibrant, diverse, and inclusive team that embodies our company’s values: proactivity, kindness, candor, and humility. We aspire to continually grow as individuals and as an organization to live these values and realize our mission. We earnestly believe that Afresh represents a one-of-a-kind opportunity to have massive social impact at scale by employing novel technology—and to have a ton of fun along the way.
Afresh provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, marital status, pregnancy or related condition, or any other basis protected by law"

Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.
Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, and past behaviors. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.
We’re looking for a thoughtful, data-savvy, and product-focused designer to join our growing team. In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to drive the visual and interaction identity of Sisu, as well as design and launch a wide range of product experiences from concept to implementation. You’ll have a big impact on our customers, our overall business, and Sisu’s future growth. For a sense of how we like to work with each other and approach problems, check out Sisu’s values.
What you'll accomplish:
Refine and implement Sisu’s look and feel in the product
Design and ship business-critical, user-centric, data-oriented product experiences
Create storyboards, wireframes, and prototypes to communicate your ideas to the team
Work cross-functionally with product, engineering, and sales to identify and prioritize customer needs
Elevate design thinking and culture at Sisu, as part of our small, but growing design team
What you'll need to be successful:
A strong sense of design fundamentals, including iconography, typography, color, and data visualization
Creativity, persistence, and inquisitiveness about analytics, BI, and enterprise data, and the desire to help businesses solve problems in new ways
A track record of designing and building rich, accessible desktop experiences
Ability to design and iterate quickly and efficiently in a dynamic setting
Comfort tackling ambiguous problem spaces and ability to bring clarity through problem definition, scoping, and prioritization for design
Prior experience conducting customer research of any type and ability to synthesize qualitative feedback with data to guide design decisions
Experience teaming up with engineers and designers to build and ship products
Familiarity with design tools, such as Figma, Sketch, and Principle
Nice to have:
Prior experience building enterprise or data-oriented products
Prior experience with data visualization
For a product designer, there’s no better environment to advance your career, develop your skills, and make an impact along the way. As you mature in this role, you’ll have the chance to work with global leaders, learn from industry mavericks, and help build an amazing, eclectic, and supportive organization.
Sisu is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status."

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.


A unique opportunity

We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, Susa, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

Sr. ML Solutions Architect, AWS Startups

Do you like startups? Are you interested in cloud computing? Are you passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning? Yes? We have a role you might find interesting.

Startups are the large enterprises of the future. These young companies are founded by ambitious people who have a desire to build something meaningful and challenge the status quo. They seek to address underserved customers, or to challenge incumbents. They usually operate in an environment of scarcity: whether that’s capital, engineering resource, or experience. This is where you come in.

We are looking for technical builders with a background in AI and ML who love the idea of working with startups that differentiate their product via the application of Machine Learning. In this role, you’ll work directly with these customers, helping them make the build and deploy their products, services, and models in the cloud successfully. You’ll have a chance to build enduring relationships with these companies and establish yourself as a trusted advisor.

As well as spending time working directly with customers, you’ll also get plenty of time to “sharpen the saw” and keep your skills fresh. We have more than 175 services across a range of different categories and it’s important that we can help startups take advantages of the right ones. You’ll also play an important role as an advocate with our product teams to make sure we are building the right products and features for the startups you work with. And for the customers you don’t get to work with on a 1:1 basis you’ll share knowledge more broadly by working on technical content and presenting at events.

About the hiring group

The AWS Startup Solutions Architecture team is dedicated to working with these early stage startup companies as they build their businesses. We’re here to make sure that they can deploy the best, most scalable, and most secure architectures possible – and that they spend as little time and money as possible doing so.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have twelve employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded professional and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

As this role supports customers that are building their products and services that leverage the Machine Learning as a product or service differentiator, additional experience in the following Machine Learning areas are highly desired:

Experience in ML models and distributed training
Expertise in Data Architecture.
Experience in Machine Learning optimized infrastructure, such as GPUs.
Intermediate or advanced experience architecting/operating ML stacks built on AWS is preferred.
Senior leadership role at a startup.
Working knowledge of software development tools and methodologies
Demonstrated ability to adapt to new technologies and learn quickly.
AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate, Professional, Machine Learning, or Analytics specialty.
Experience developing and deploying modern application architectures, including serverless and containerized solutions.

Amazon is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace.

"Machine Learning Modeler, Ecommerce",Square,"San Francisco, CA",3.7,None,Posted29 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=d7d444a131f64d29&fccid=09abad886b83c501&vjs=3,"Company Description
Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.

Job Description
Content is king — Square merchants succeed when their content conveys the story and value of their products effectively. Yet the average merchant is not an expert in product photography, copywriting, SEO, or design. Furthermore, the average merchant has many existing sources of content available to them, but digitizing them to put them on an online store requires tedious manual effort. These factors hinder merchants from putting their best foot forward and starting selling online quickly.
The Square Ecommerce ML team focuses on removing these frictions by using ML to help merchants import, manage, and improve their content. We have successful applications for some of these problems, but we're still discovering the best ways to accomplish this and the best applications for ML in this context. We're looking for a creative ML Engineer that is interested in building merchant-facing products, that is excited about finding novel ways of applying existing ML techniques to create exciting new products, and that is comfortable finding the right balance of algorithmic performance and simplicity to reduce time-to-market.
You will:
Work on deep learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) applications to improve document understanding, merchant site content, and merchant photography.
Help procure, curate, and QA annotated data for new document parsing applications as well as for computer vision applications.
Identify and use existing SOTA models, or build custom models based on SOTA approaches in NLP and CV, by reviewing the literature to identify best solutions to merchant problems.
Work with product, design, and web/mobile engineering stakeholders to productionalize models into merchant-facing features by deploying them to services or mobile applications.
In the long term, support or independently drive discovery of novel applications of ML to text and image content import, classification, and transformation.

Qualifications
You Have:
A Bachelor's degree with 2-3 years of experience in software development or a MSc/PhD with 0-2 years of experience.
Already graduated or will be able to start working full-time in the next month.
A strong modeling background, and experience building pipelines, modeling, and experimenting in frameworks like Keras or Pytorch.
Experience training deep learning models for NLP applications or CV applications. If recently graduated, candidate should have thesis work or publications in these fields or closely related ones.
Experience building services to serve ML applications in real-time, using technologies like Flask and MySQL.
Working knowledge with cloud services like AWS, GCS, and their command line utilities.
Experience working on ML projects end to end while collaborating with a variety of stakeholders.
Preferred:
Experience modifying SOTA deep learning architectures and experimenting with them to improve model performance.
Demonstrated technical leadership and initiative in previous projects.
Experience driving ML projects from beginning to end independently.
The ability to convert open-ended product requirements into concrete ML solutions with a well-defined scope.

About Us

UpTogether is a national organization of individuals across the country with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities who share a passion for social justice and racial equity. Our mission is to recognize, highlight and invest in the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of people in historically undervalued communities and partner with government and philanthropy to do the same.
After working with thousands of families since our founding in 2001, at UpTogether, we are certain people don’t live in poverty because they are lazy, uneducated, or mismanage money, as stereotypes would indicate. Instead, the poverty cycle, which disproportionately impacts Black and Latinx communities, can be traced to well-intentioned but inadequate governmental and charitable policies and practices that rely on a traditional top-down approach.
UpTogether’s Strengths Based Approach (SBA) includes:

Community: We center our work around the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Capital: We invest in our members with unrestricted cash in recognition of the initiatives they are taking to improve their lives.
Choice: We trust that people in undervalued communities know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.

UpTogether reveals and accelerates the initiative people are taking to improve their lives.

As a community, a movement, and a platform, we use the power of information—compelling insights and personal success stories—to transform stereotypes, beliefs, practices, and policies. Together with our members, we are championing a community-led movement to boost economic and social mobility in communities that have been undervalued and underinvested in for far too long.
At UpTogether, we work toward these values:

Community: We honor the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Impact: We test and scale strategies for systems adoption of a strength-based approach to accelerate socioeconomic mobility for people living at or below the poverty line in the U.S.
Collaboration: We center the lived experiences of families in undervalued communities and engage the knowledge, experience, and perspectives of our board, partners, and staff to build and grow a strength-based approach to end poverty.
Racial Equity: We are committed to being an anti-racist organization, and we promote anti-racist policies that eliminate the racial wealth divide.
Leadership: We acknowledge that leadership is not based on a title and honor the many forms in which it appears. We celebrate leadership that embodies all of our organizational values, driving us to act against the dominating deficit-based approach to fighting poverty.
Choice: We trust that people living at or below the poverty line know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.
