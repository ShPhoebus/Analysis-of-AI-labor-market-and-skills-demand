A small team of four (and growing) world-class front-end engineers and designers; and
Various other teams and stakeholders across 0x Labs

MATCHA TECH STACK

We don’t care much about your experience with our stack (or any specific stack); we care far more that someone has solid fundamentals, is generally intelligent, has strong learning agility, and is an overall good human. We understand it takes time to ramp, and we’re happy to invest with the right person if necessary.

Next.js
React (we use Hooks heavily!)
TypeScript
react-spring and react-use-gesture for high-performance animations and interactions
styled-components
AlchemyAPI and ethers 5.0 for interacting with Ethereum

Be a steward and influencer of our early engineering culture

REQUIREMENTS

Bachelor's or equivalent

You’ll be expected to bring your own experience and perspective to help us do the right things, and raise flags if you think we should do things differently.In order to thrive here, you’ll have to extend beyond your zone of genius to to bridge between engineering, clinical, and research.

You'll be driving the design of the research participant experience. You'll have templates and procedures in place to make everything from recruitment through compensation as safe, efficient, comfortable, and inclusive as we can make it.
You'll develop a backlog of evaluative research questions to be answered through testing, transcript review, and other methods, and work with UX and product leadership to prioritize and execute that work on a regular cadence.
You'll curate a repository of past findings, making it easy for anyone in the company to ask: ""What do we know about ___?""
You'll participate in formative studies as needed to inform the vision for new products or features, making sure we're always using the latest findings to inform decisions. Depending on your skills, you may lead some of these studies.
You'll be equally comfortable leading studies with or without other team members or on your own, as circumstances require.
You'll identify opportunities to blend qualitative analysis with our data team's quantitative techniques to maximize the quality of our insights.

At 0x Labs, our mission is to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely. We're a highly technical, globally distributed group of teams working together toward actualizing that mission. In doing so, we're excited and proud to be pushing the envelope across the DeFi and Ethereum stacks.

In joining us, you'll take part in transforming the way that value is exchanged on a global scale. We're passionate about open-source software and decentralized technology's potential to act as an equalizing force in the world, and our technology is deployed by a wide array of projects at the forefront of internet and economic advancement.

Founded in 2017, 0x Labs created and now partakes in the development of 0x protocol: a network comprised of open-source infrastructure, tooling, and cryptocurrency-based incentives that allow for the decentralized exchange of any blockchain-based digital asset. 0x is a secure, publicly owned and governed, and upgradable standard that’s abstracted away from application-layer developers and enables interoperability between blockchain-based applications.

Alongside the core protocol, 0x Labs also builds and maintains a suite of network incentives, business resources, developer/trader tools (e.g., 0x API), and end-user products (e.g., Matcha).

We’re a remote-first company with core contributors in nearly ten countries and over twice as many cities. Our headquarters is in San Francisco, with an office available for anyone on the team to use at any time.

We’ll consider your application regardless of where you call home.

MATCHA

Built on top of 0x API, Matcha is a meticulously designed decentralized exchange that makes it safe and easy for anyone in the world to access crypto assets on the Ethereum blockchain. We provide users with the best prices by aggregating liquidity from all of the major decentralized exchanges and splitting/routing orders intelligently.


By focusing on user experience and education, Matcha will onboard the next wave of users into the DeFi ecosystem. As a Front-End Engineer on the team, you’ll take large and early part in building out this flagship product.

You’ll work closely alongside:

John Johnson, Matcha's Engineering Manager. Before joining 0x Labs and building Matcha, John led frontend development at Textio, the leading NLP-enabled writing platform; and prior, worked at Ultimate Software (acquired) building out payroll APIs and other financial technology products.
A small team of four (and growing) world-class front-end engineers and designers; and
Various other teams and stakeholders across 0x Labs

MATCHA TECH STACK

We don’t care much about your experience with our stack (or any specific stack); we care far more that someone has solid fundamentals, is generally intelligent, has strong learning agility, and is an overall good human. We understand it takes time to ramp, and we’re happy to invest with the right person if necessary.


That said, we’re excited about the rapidly evolving tech we’re building on. It includes:

Next.js
React (we use Hooks heavily!)
TypeScript
react-spring and react-use-gesture for high-performance animations and interactions
styled-components
AlchemyAPI and ethers 5.0 for interacting with Ethereum
Vercel for continuous deployment and infrastructure
Linear for project management

RESPONSIBILITIES

Create trustworthy user experiences by building, testing, and shipping features that are simple, intuitive, performant, and reliable
Own entire features from specification to shipping
Work effectively with a high degree of autonomy, within a collaboratively minded team
Keep abreast of the nascent and rapidly evolving blockchain space, and introduce innovative tools and products
Collaborate cross-functionally with other teams, including engineering (internal and external), design, research, data science, product management, executive leadership, and recruiting
Be a steward and influencer of our early engineering culture

REQUIREMENTS

Bachelor's or equivalent
Experience with modern JavaScript
Experience with React
Experience with CSS/HTML
Passion for the benefits of decentralization and the 0x mission
Exhibit our core values: do the right thing, consistently ship, and focus on long-term impact

PREFERRED

Proficiency with TypeScript (Matcha is written completely in strict-mode TypeScript)
Experience optimizing front-end performance (we take application performance very seriously)

BENEFITS

Competitive salary and equity with occasional cryptocurrency-based perks
Comprehensive insurance (medical/dental/vision) — 100% covered for you and your family
401k, HSA, and FSA for U.S.-based employees
Stipend for your ideal remote / WFH set-up: laptop, headphones, and any other work gear you may need
Flexible hours and a long-standing, supportive remote environment
Monthly co-working space and mobile phone expense
12-week paid parental leave
Great office conveniently located in Soma/East Cut, SF, available for all team members

Senior Interaction Designer / UX Designer,Woebot Health,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=84fae501587e4a60&fccid=6a5314410fd34d37&vjs=3,"Our mission is to make the best mental health tools radically accessible to everyone.

We're a venture-backed startup building tools to help millions of people monitor, regulate and ultimately improve their moods. Our tools are primarily chat-based. They're powered by the latest research in NLP and ML, use scientifically proven techniques from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and are based on 10 years of digital mental health research at Stanford University.

We are redefining how people access mental health care and are building the dream team that's excited about getting us there. Your ability to translate user needs and clinical principles into buildable solutions will be essential to delivering on that promise.


WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN OUR TEAM:

Do you want to work in a place where ""It's the right thing to do"" is a winning argument? We won't pretend we don't have to make tradeoffs about scope or business needs, but everyone here is deeply committed to user safety and well-being. Your job is to design buildable product experiences that bring that vision to life, based on both your expertise in general HCI principles as well as Woebot-specific principles and data. Because the Woebot experience is closely intertwined with how our proprietary conversation management system works, you'll work on a juicy variety of both app UI and complex platform design problems.


How You'll Thrive

Your first month

In your first few weeks, you'll get to know how the Woebot teams and products work. You'll catch up on our design principles, what we already know about our audiences, and where we plan to go from here.
You'll spend time getting to know our system architecture, what's easy, and what's hard.
You'll understand the state of our design tools and processes and identify what else you need to be successful.

Your second month

You'll work on projects that make Woebot smarter, more usable, and more useful. This might involve anything from helping users gain insight from their data to helping the conversation writing team make conversations even more person-specific.
You'll begin contributing to product requirements in collaboration with clinicians, writers, PMs, engineers, and the UX research and data teams.
You'll work with PM, engineering, and QA to make sure we're making the right tradeoffs in implementation, timing, and design intent.

Your third month and beyond

You'll be leading design efforts that define substantial chunks of our user experience and internal tools. Where necessary, you'll work with PM, engineering, and content teams to define how our architecture or internal tools should evolve to support improved app experiences.
Woebot isn't so much engagement-focused as outcome-focused: what makes people well? You'll be helping us identify how we can get users to spend the right amount of time in the parts of the product that matter most.
In collaboration with conversation designers and writers, you'll look for opportunities to go beyond conversation: where might a video, a diagram, or some other form of communication be more effective?
You'll take an end-to-end view of the app experience for patients, caregivers, and clinicians.
You'll be continually improving how you work across teams, and contributing to UX team growth through mentoring, documentation, or other leadership opportunities that fit your skills.

Requirements

Bachelor's degree in a related field preferred
Minimum 8 years of experience in an interaction design role, with 2-3 leading projects of at least medium scope and complexity.
Demonstrated ability to select and competently apply design principles and patterns to complex problems, from the conceptual to the detailed design stage. Although you don't need to be a visual designer, you do need to be visually literate, able to apply an existing design system to your work, and generally aware of iOS, Android, Web, and accessibility conventions.
Strong project management, collaboration, and communication skills.
A commitment to designing based on data rather than opinion, but with sufficient knowledge of the HCI evidence that you're comfortable making strong recommendations prior to testing.
An understanding of the limitations and biases in both your life experience and your methods, and a commitment to minimizing or mitigating those.
Not required, but it's a big plus if you have prior experience with:
Chatbots, voice UIs, or other language-based interfaces
Adolescents and / or users with mental health concerns
Content management systems

Our Core Values

Empathic: You're a compassionate person and a team player motivated to understand others and help them be successful, too. You care as deeply for your colleagues as you do for our mission and our users.
Growth mindset: You believe abilities – like intelligence and talent – can be developed through dedication and hard work. You see failure as an opportunity to grow and welcome feedback as a pathway to your continued success.
Humble: You recognize that you are one among many, and you hold a genuine desire to discover what other people can offer. You are intrigued by how others think, and how others feel differently from you. You lean into these moments with patience and curiosity.
Self-aware: You possess a high level of emotional intelligence, which allows you to understand yourself and others, and to have a healthy emotional life in the workplace.
Proactive & flexible:You are able to hit the ground running, you take responsibility for finding a way to get the job done. You learn as quickly as possible and sometimes do things outside the immediate scope of your work, giving it all you've got.
Strong work-ethic: You've mastered healthy habits in your life that allow you to do great things. You exemplify dedication and commitment to coming up with very good results in your work and inspire others to do the same.

Design experiments, including for offline prototypes in a statistically sound way that will provide actionable data and enable us to make reliable decisions as we iterate on a project.
Promote excellence and best practices across the machine learning team in regards to research, implementation, tooling, and system design.
Work cross-functionally across multiple partner teams to get new features shipped across our many interfaces.
We’re looking for someone who

Has enough experience with academic research to be comfortable reading and implementing papers to reproduce their results.
Support for you, professionally and personally
Professional growth: We hire people we trust, and we give team members autonomy to do their best work. We also support professional development with training, coaching, and regular feedback.
A connected team: Grammarly builds products that help people connect, and we apply this mindset to our own team. We have a highly collaborative culture supported by our EAGER values. We also take time to celebrate our colleagues and accomplishments with global, local, and team-specific events and programs.
Comprehensive benefits: Grammarly offers all team members competitive pay along with a benefits package that includes superior health care. We also offer support to set up a home office, ample and defined time off, gym and recreation stipends, admission discounts, and more.
We encourage you to apply

At Grammarly, we value our differences, and we encourage all—especially those whose identities are traditionally underrepresented in tech organizations—to apply.

Square builds common business tools in unconventional ways so more people can start, run, and grow their businesses. When Square started, it was difficult and expensive (or just plain impossible) for some businesses to take credit cards. Square made credit card payments possible for all by turning a mobile phone into a credit card reader. Since then Square has been building an entire business toolkit of both hardware and software products including Square Capital, Square Terminal, Square Payroll, and more. We’re working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we’re looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.

Job Description
Content is king — Square merchants succeed when their content conveys the story and value of their products effectively. Yet the average merchant is not an expert in product photography, copywriting, SEO, or design. Furthermore, the average merchant has many existing sources of content available to them, but digitizing them to put them on an online store requires tedious manual effort. These factors hinder merchants from putting their best foot forward and starting selling online quickly.
The Square Ecommerce ML team focuses on removing these frictions by using ML to help merchants import, manage, and improve their content. We have successful applications for some of these problems, but we're still discovering the best ways to accomplish this and the best applications for ML in this context. We're looking for a creative ML Engineer that is interested in building merchant-facing products, that is excited about finding novel ways of applying existing ML techniques to create exciting new products, and that is comfortable finding the right balance of algorithmic performance and simplicity to reduce time-to-market.
You will:
Work on deep learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) applications to improve document understanding, merchant site content, and merchant photography.
Help procure, curate, and QA annotated data for new document parsing applications as well as for computer vision applications.
Identify and use existing SOTA models, or build custom models based on SOTA approaches in NLP and CV, by reviewing the literature to identify best solutions to merchant problems.
Work with product, design, and web/mobile engineering stakeholders to productionalize models into merchant-facing features by deploying them to services or mobile applications.
In the long term, support or independently drive discovery of novel applications of ML to text and image content import, classification, and transformation.

Qualifications
You Have:
A Bachelor's degree with 2-3 years of experience in software development or a MSc/PhD with 0-2 years of experience.
Already graduated or will be able to start working full-time in the next month.
A strong modeling background, and experience building pipelines, modeling, and experimenting in frameworks like Keras or Pytorch.
Experience training deep learning models for NLP applications or CV applications. If recently graduated, candidate should have thesis work or publications in these fields or closely related ones.
Experience building services to serve ML applications in real-time, using technologies like Flask and MySQL.
Working knowledge with cloud services like AWS, GCS, and their command line utilities.
Experience working on ML projects end to end while collaborating with a variety of stakeholders.
Preferred:
Experience modifying SOTA deep learning architectures and experimenting with them to improve model performance.
Demonstrated technical leadership and initiative in previous projects.
Experience driving ML projects from beginning to end independently.
The ability to convert open-ended product requirements into concrete ML solutions with a well-defined scope.

Position description
The School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley seeks applications for a pool of part-time, non-tenure track lecturers to teach courses in Data Science. We are seeking outstanding lecturers who can teach 15-person sections in our web-based Master’s in Information and Data Science program (datascience.berkeley.edu). Screening of applicants is ongoing and will continue as needed. The number of positions varies from semester to semester, depending on the needs of the School. Positions typically start in January, May, and August, and appointments may be renewed based on need, funding, and performance. Due to budget restrictions, no funding is available for visa or relocation expenses.
About The I School
UC Berkeley’s newest school, the School of Information (I School), was created in 1994 to address one of society’s most compelling challenges: the need to organize and make sense of the abundance of information that we can now collect, store, and share without regard for cost or distance. The way we organize, represent, govern, and make sense of this information will shape our ability to achieve public as well as private goals.
The I School educates professionals and scholars to understand the problems and possibilities of information, to develop models of information practice, and to design useful and usable information applications, services, and solutions. This requires insights from diverse fields. Our faculty includes scholars and professionals with deep expertise in information and computer science, social sciences, management, law, design, and policy, as well as related fields.
The I School offers three professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. Our MIMS program trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. Our MIDS program trains data scientists to manage and analyze the coming onslaught of big data, in a unique high-touch online degree. Our MICS program prepares cybersecurity leaders with the technical skills and contextual knowledge necessary to develop solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges. Our Ph.D. program equips scholars to develop solutions and shape policies that influence how people seek, use, and share information.
Our students and graduates work at well-known Bay Area companies that include Apple, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well as at nonprofits like Kaiser Permanente and established businesses like Wells Fargo and Chevron.

In April of 2021, Punchh agreed to be acquired by PAR Technology Corporation (NYSE: PAR), a leading global provider of restaurant software.

We're hands-on people. We keep our room clean and make our bed because details matter. We believe it is better to be fast than big, and that being both is best. We believe diversity creates strong systems and communities. We experiment. Sometimes we break things, but we learn quickly. We're honest and our intentions are good. And we always offer the last slice of dessert to our guests. We've got each other's and our customers' backs no matter what

Over 80,000 developers worldwide use the Nylas platform to quickly and securely build productivity features into their applications. With Nylas, developers get unprecedented access to rich communications data from their end-users, pre-built workflows that automate everyday tasks, embeddable UI/UX components for fast front-end development, and comprehensive security features - all delivered via a suite of powerful APIs that make integration easy.

Who We Are

Nylas was founded in 2013 and has raised over $175M to date from Tiger Global, 8VC, Spark Capital, Slack, and more; as well as individual investors including Patrick Collison, Co-Founder and CEO of Stripe, John Collison, President and Co-Founder of Stripe, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of Klarna, and Tony Fadell. Developers around the world use Nylas to quickly and securely build email, scheduling, and work automation features into their applications. Nylas customers include Upwork, Wix, Freshworks, Lever, Dialpad, Ceridian, and Move.com.

Our Work Philosophy

Nylas is also a big believer in the safety and well-being of our employees and society, which is why we are onboarding all new Nylanauts remotely during this global pandemic until there is a vaccine and it is safe for humans to resume their pre-COVID lifestyles.

AND once COVID-19 pandemic eventually comes to an end, we will continue to embrace Remote First philosophy, with a minor twist: Remote First, Office Second. That's right! It's about how you work, not where you work. Nylanauts can choose any workspace or environment that will result in more ideas, engagement, creativity, focus, collaboration, and productivity. It's true. They can go anywhere as long as they respect the working hours (time zones) of their team. Wherever motivates them; inspires them to be better versions of themselves. This means Nylanauts can work from the slopes of Missoula before traveling to the beaches of San Diego. Wonderful!

And if Nylanauts want to work from an office in one of our hubs (San Francisco, Denver, New York City, Toronto, and London), they can. Go ahead! The workspace is there to be utilized.
Why Remote First, Office Second? Because we not only believe in respecting individual working styles, disabilities, and personal schedules, but also ensuring everyone has a better work-life balance. The outcomes will always be more important than the physical location.

Verkada is the leading physical security platform to protect people, assets and privacy. Designed with simplicity in mind, Verkada’s five product lines - video security cameras, access control, environmental sensors, alarms and visitor management - provide seamless visibility through an integrated secure cloud-based software platform. Over 8,700 organizations worldwide trust Verkada as their physical security layer for easier management, frictionless scalability and cutting-edge innovation.
In order to protect the world, we need to talk to tens of millions of decision-makers and explain how Verkada products work. To do that at scale we build in-house solutions that optimize every single detail in the business conversation flow.
At the core of it is our understanding of web protocols and language, as well as the discipline of execution and innovation.
In contrast to classical SWE roles, we focus on 'zero to one' innovation first, and scalability/reliability second. In contrast to classical DS positions, we design software that involve humans in-the-loop ('hybrid AI'), which implies a stronger focus on architecture and UI rather than pure model training. In contrast to growth teams, we are 100% makers, we build things in-house and rethink the communication from a systems perspective. Essentially, we create scalable middleware that aligns the passion of Verkada product engineers with the needs of prospective customers.
Therefore, to be successful at the job you need to be willing to connect the dots across engineering, practical data science and product. This role will challenge you as you'd need to grow as a generalist, learn from others across different areas and focus on one area to master.

"Software Engineer, Content",Nylas,"San Francisco, CA 94103 (South of Market area)",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=93636ea771bea0e6&fccid=c73f42ea32794290&vjs=3,"Nylas is a pioneer and leading provider of productivity infrastructure solutions for modern software. Over 80,000 developers worldwide use the Nylas platform to quickly and securely build productivity features into their applications. With Nylas, developers get unprecedented access to rich communications data from their end-users, pre-built workflows that automate everyday tasks, embeddable UI/UX components for fast front-end development, and comprehensive security features - all delivered via a suite of powerful APIs that make integration easy.

Who We Are

Nylas was founded in 2013 and has raised over $175M to date from Tiger Global, 8VC, Spark Capital, Slack, and more; as well as individual investors including Patrick Collison, Co-Founder and CEO of Stripe, John Collison, President and Co-Founder of Stripe, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of Klarna, and Tony Fadell. Developers around the world use Nylas to quickly and securely build email, scheduling, and work automation features into their applications. Nylas customers include Upwork, Wix, Freshworks, Lever, Dialpad, Ceridian, and Move.com.

Our Work Philosophy

Nylas is also a big believer in the safety and well-being of our employees and society, which is why we are onboarding all new Nylanauts remotely during this global pandemic until there is a vaccine and it is safe for humans to resume their pre-COVID lifestyles.

AND once COVID-19 pandemic eventually comes to an end, we will continue to embrace Remote First philosophy, with a minor twist: Remote First, Office Second. That's right! It's about how you work, not where you work. Nylanauts can choose any workspace or environment that will result in more ideas, engagement, creativity, focus, collaboration, and productivity. It's true. They can go anywhere as long as they respect the working hours (time zones) of their team. Wherever motivates them; inspires them to be better versions of themselves. This means Nylanauts can work from the slopes of Missoula before traveling to the beaches of San Diego. Wonderful!

And if Nylanauts want to work from an office in one of our hubs (San Francisco, Denver, New York City, Toronto, and London), they can. Go ahead! The workspace is there to be utilized.
Why Remote First, Office Second? Because we not only believe in respecting individual working styles, disabilities, and personal schedules, but also ensuring everyone has a better work-life balance. The outcomes will always be more important than the physical location.

Our family

We are a member of Omnicom's Precision Marketing Group (OPMG) focused on digital and CRM marketing . Our data science team partners closely with our Creative, Strategy, Analytics and Technology colleagues.

No pressure, though - if you aren't comfortable with coming in while COVID-19 plays out, you can still work where you work best. That said, while we do have our ""work where you work best"" philosophy, we legally have to care about what state you claim permanent residency in (it's a tax thing).

From developing innovative biotech solutions to providing the infrastructure that Silicon Valley runs on we provide smart solutions for Bay Area clients like Aimmune Therapeutics and Palo Alto Networks

ABOUT YOU

You have 5+ years of experience in a data science or engineering role and a graduate degree.

You love to share your findings to colleagues and clients and work with them to ensure it moves the needle on their business.

You enjoy working on a variety of projects simultaneously and applying new techniques and are never one to rest on your past accomplishments.

You want to help define our R&D agenda and drive product development efforts in areas like Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Measuring Incrementality.

What else? Maybe you're passionate about social issues? Or maybe you have an impressive vinyl collection? Perhaps you spend as much time exploring nature as you do writing code? We'd love to know what makes you, you."

Posted Date: Oct 27 2021
At GSK we see a world in which advanced applications of machine learning and AI will allow us to develop novel therapies to existing diseases and to quickly respond to emerging or changing diseases with personalized drugs, driving better outcomes at reduced cost with fewer side effects. It is an ambitious vision that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of machine learning and AI. If that excites you, we'd love to chat.
The AIML Sequence Learning Team applies machine learning and AI methods to DNA and RNA sequence data from large-scale human genetic, functional genomic and single cell experiments. DNA sequence variations are linked to disease via changes in the nature and abundance of protein and RNA gene products. The Sequence Learning group builds models directly from DNA/RNA sequence in addition to other data sources such as chromatin state. Models that operate on a sequence level can infer changes in protein/RNA states and the associated cellular function from sequence alone. This is an exciting methodological advance at the intersection of NLP inspired language models applied to biological data.
We're looking for a highly accomplished AI/ML Engineer to join our team. Competitive candidates will have a track record of shipping high performing AI/ML powered products in production environments. They are highly accomplished Machine Learning Engineers, with breadth across Machine Learning Methods, as well as depth in at least one area.

At GSK we see a world in which advanced applications of machine learning and AI will allow us to develop novel therapies to existing diseases and to quickly respond to emerging or changing diseases with personalized drugs, driving better outcomes at reduced cost with fewer side effects. It is an ambitious vision that will require the development of products and solutions at the cutting edge of machine learning and AI. If that excites you, we'd love to chat.
The AIML Sequence Learning Team applies machine learning and AI methods to DNA and RNA sequence data from large-scale human genetic, functional genomic and single cell experiments. DNA sequence variations are linked to disease via changes in the nature and abundance of protein and RNA gene products. The Sequence Learning group builds models directly from DNA/RNA sequence in addition to other data sources such as chromatin state. Models that operate on a sequence level can infer changes in protein/RNA states and the associated cellular function from sequence alone. This is an exciting methodological advance at the intersection of NLP inspired language models applied to biological data.
We're looking for a highly accomplished AI/ML Engineer to join our team. Competitive candidates will have a track record of shipping high performing AI/ML powered products in production environments.

About The I School
UC Berkeley’s newest school, the School of Information (I School), was created in 1994 to address one of society’s most compelling challenges: the need to organize and make sense of the abundance of information that we can now collect, store, and share without regard for cost or distance. The way we organize, represent, govern, and make sense of this information will shape our ability to achieve public as well as private goals.
The I School educates professionals and scholars to understand the problems and possibilities of information, to develop models of information practice, and to design useful and usable information applications, services, and solutions. This requires insights from diverse fields. Our faculty includes scholars and professionals with deep expertise in information and computer science, social sciences, management, law, design, and policy, as well as related fields.
The I School offers three professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. Our MIMS program trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. Our MIDS program trains data scientists to manage and analyze the coming onslaught of big data, in a unique high-touch online degree. Our MICS program prepares cybersecurity leaders with the technical skills and contextual knowledge necessary to develop solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges. Our Ph.D. program equips scholars to develop solutions and shape policies that influence how people seek, use, and share information.
Our students and graduates work at well-known Bay Area companies that include Apple, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well as at nonprofits like Kaiser Permanente and established businesses like Wells Fargo and Chevron. Many of our graduates take advantage of the opportunity to get in on the ground floor to create or work for start-ups.

Are you passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning? Are you passionate about helping customers build solutions leveraging the state-of-the-art AI/ML/DL tools on Amazon Web Service (AWS)? Come join us!

At Amazon, we’ve been investing deeply in artificial intelligence for over 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers experience are driven by machine learning. Amazon.com’s recommendations engine is driven by machine learning (ML), as are the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers. Our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are also informed by ML algorithms. Alexa is fueled by Natural Language Understanding and Automated Speech Recognition deep learning; as is Prime Air, and the computer vision technology in our new retail experience, Amazon Go. We have thousands of engineers at Amazon committed to machine learning and deep learning, and it’s a big part of our heritage.

Within AWS, we’re focused on bringing that knowledge and capability to customers through three layers of the AI stack: 1) Frameworks and Infrastructure with tools like Apache MxNet and TensorFlow, 2) Machine Learning Platforms such as Amazon SageMaker for data scientists and 3) API-driven Services like Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Forecast, Amazon Personalize, Amazon Rekognition, Lookout for Equipment, Monitron, Lookout for Metric, Panorama, Lookout for Vision, Health AI, and Amazon Textract to quickly add intelligence to applications with a simple API call.

And, most important - you will act as the steward for developing winning CCI solutions for our customers.

Roles and Responsibilities

Act as a technical liaison between customers and the AI services engineering teams to provide customer driven product improvement feedback.
Develop and support an AWS internal community of AI related subject matter experts.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have twelve employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship.

About The I School
UC Berkeley’s newest school, the School of Information (I School), was created in 1994 to address one of society’s most compelling challenges: the need to organize and make sense of the abundance of information that we can now collect, store, and share without regard for cost or distance. The way we organize, represent, govern, and make sense of this information will shape our ability to achieve public as well as private goals.
The I School educates professionals and scholars to understand the problems and possibilities of information, to develop models of information practice, and to design useful and usable information applications, services, and solutions. This requires insights from diverse fields. Our faculty includes scholars and professionals with deep expertise in information and computer science, social sciences, management, law, design, and policy, as well as related fields.
The I School offers three professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. Our MIMS program trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. Our MIDS program trains data scientists to manage and analyze the coming onslaught of big data, in a unique high-touch online degree. Our MICS program prepares cybersecurity leaders with the technical skills and contextual knowledge necessary to develop solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges. Our Ph.D. program equips scholars to develop solutions and shape policies that influence how people seek, use, and share information.
Our students and graduates work at well-known Bay Area companies that include Apple, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well as at nonprofits like Kaiser Permanente and established businesses like Wells Fargo and Chevron. Many of our graduates take advantage of the opportunity to get in on the ground floor to create or work for start-ups.

About The I School
UC Berkeley’s newest school, the School of Information (I School), was created in 1994 to address one of society’s most compelling challenges: the need to organize and make sense of the abundance of information that we can now collect, store, and share without regard for cost or distance. The way we organize, represent, govern, and make sense of this information will shape our ability to achieve public as well as private goals.
The I School educates professionals and scholars to understand the problems and possibilities of information, to develop models of information practice, and to design useful and usable information applications, services, and solutions. This requires insights from diverse fields. Our faculty includes scholars and professionals with deep expertise in information and computer science, social sciences, management, law, design, and policy, as well as related fields.
The I School offers three professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. Our MIMS program trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. Our MIDS program trains data scientists to manage and analyze the coming onslaught of big data, in a unique high-touch online degree. Our MICS program prepares cybersecurity leaders with the technical skills and contextual knowledge necessary to develop solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges. Our Ph.D. program equips scholars to develop solutions and shape policies that influence how people seek, use, and share information.
Our students and graduates work at well-known Bay Area companies that include Apple, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well as at nonprofits like Kaiser Permanente and established businesses like Wells Fargo and Chevron. Many of our graduates take advantage of the opportunity to get in on the ground floor to create or work for start-ups.

About The I School
UC Berkeley’s newest school, the School of Information (I School), was created in 1994 to address one of society’s most compelling challenges: the need to organize and make sense of the abundance of information that we can now collect, store, and share without regard for cost or distance. The way we organize, represent, govern, and make sense of this information will shape our ability to achieve public as well as private goals.
The I School educates professionals and scholars to understand the problems and possibilities of information, to develop models of information practice, and to design useful and usable information applications, services, and solutions. This requires insights from diverse fields. Our faculty includes scholars and professionals with deep expertise in information and computer science, social sciences, management, law, design, and policy, as well as related fields.
The I School offers three professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. Our MIMS program trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. Our MIDS program trains data scientists to manage and analyze the coming onslaught of big data, in a unique high-touch online degree. Our MICS program prepares cybersecurity leaders with the technical skills and contextual knowledge necessary to develop solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges. Our Ph.D. program equips scholars to develop solutions and shape policies that influence how people seek, use, and share information.
Our students and graduates work at well-known Bay Area companies that include Apple, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well as at nonprofits like Kaiser Permanente and established businesses like Wells Fargo and Chevron. Many of our graduates take advantage of the opportunity to get in on the ground floor to create or work for start-ups.
