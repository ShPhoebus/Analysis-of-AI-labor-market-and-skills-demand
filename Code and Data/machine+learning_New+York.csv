Data Scientist,Nautilus Labs,"New York, NY",None,None,Posted11 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=2267fd09a42963b1&fccid=fcf358f3bd84e30a&vjs=3,"About Nautilus.

Nautilus is building artificial intelligence to advance the efficiency of ocean commerce. We deliver technology to help shipping companies minimize fuel consumption, maximize operational efficiency, and optimize fleet performance. By arming ship owners and operators with real-time predictive decision support, Nautilus is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and making global trade sustainable.

Ocean shipping consumes over $100 billion dollars of fuel every year, and up to 30% of it can be saved. For owner-operators, reliance on manually collected and analyzed data makes it difficult to optimize fleet performance in real-time. By providing a unified data platform that leverages machine learning, Nautilus helps its clients make better decisions to maximize the return on each ship and every voyage. For our clients, this means they drive closer collaboration, greater transparency, and stronger accountability across their global teams every day.

About you.

We are hiring a Data Scientist to join the Nautilus Labs team. You are inquisitive and enjoy exploring new research questions, and are capable of working largely independently. You have a strong foundation in statistical thinking and machine learning, with a background in data science, statistics, computer science, physics, naval architecture, mechanical engineering, or a related quantitative field. You have experience conducting technical investigations and building models with real-world data, and are able to collaborate with and communicate findings clearly with colleagues across the organization. You are comfortable building and evaluating regression models, and have experience with or interest in some combination of outlier detection, optimization methods, Bayesian methods for data analysis and modeling, model training and deployment, and cloud-based ML tooling. Familiarity with maritime, oceanographic, and meteorological data is a plus.


Regardless of whether your primary strengths and interests lie more in statistics, data investigations and research, or machine learning and MLOps, you’re interested in contributing to the full data science life-cycle: problem development and exploration; model implementation and deployment; and model applications to drive insights and client value.

Outcomes for this role.

In this role, you will be responsible for working with maritime ship and weather data to detect trends and develop or improve predictive models. You will work closely with other data scientists, data analysts, and software engineers to build, test, and deploy robust ship performance models. You will partner with our product team to help conceptualize, design, and implement new machine learning-based products. While we are a collaborative team, you will also be expected to take independent ownership of specific research and development projects. Your work will help drive product development throughout the Nautilus team, and support better client decision-making to help meet their fuel efficiency and sustainability goals.

Proficiencies.

2+ years of professional experience and/or an advanced degree, with a background in data science, statistics, computer science, physics, naval architecture, mechanical engineering, or another related quantitative field.
Strong analytical skills and knowledge of the technical and statistical underpinning of typical data science methods.
Proficiency with the Python data science stack is required; SQL, R or other data analysis languages are also valuable.
Experience conducting technical investigations and modeling with real-world data.
Collaborative with strong communication skills.
Deep experience with regression modeling and supervised learning methods.
Some combination of experience with outlier detection, optimization methods, Bayesian methods for data analysis and modeling, cloud-based ML-tooling, and MLOps best practices (note: expertise across all these areas is not expected or required)
Nice to have: Familiarity or interest in maritime, oceanographic, and meteorological data is a plus, as is experience working with and modeling physical systems.

Our core values.

Get ready to join a group of diverse, smart, talented, and driven individuals. We are looking for people who are motivated by environmentalism and a future where shipping is sustainable and safe. A team member joining Nautilus is...

We’re THOUGHTFUL, with a bias towards action.
We’re an INCLUSIVE crew, and we are not passengers along for the ride.
We’re DIRECT and we ask the tough questions.
We EMPATHIZE with humanity.

4+ years of experience architecting, building, or operating cloud-based applications or infrastructures
2+ yrs experience in a customer-facing role presenting to small and large audiences
Working knowledge of cloud technologies or similar technical background, AWS experience is preferred but not required.
Working knowledge of software development tools and methodologies
Technical degree required, or equivalent work experience; Computer Science, Math or Engineering background desired
Ability to travel, including out of state, up to 35% of the time

Do you like startups? Are you interested in cloud computing? Yes? We have a role you might find interesting.

Startups are the large enterprises of the future. These young companies are founded by ambitious people who have a desire to build something meaningful and challenge the status quo. They seek to address underserved customers, or to challenge incumbents. They usually operate in an environment of scarcity: whether that’s capital, engineering resource, or experience. This is where you come in.

We are looking for technical builders who love the idea of working with early stage startups to help them as they grow. In this role, you’ll work directly with a variety of interesting customers and help them make the best (and sometimes the most pragmatic) technical decisions along the way. You’ll have a chance to build enduring relationships with these companies and establish yourself as a trusted advisor.

This Solutions Architecture role is part of a team working exclusively with established startups looking to build net new workloads on AWS and/or migrate established production workloads onto AWS. Thus while prior experience on AWS is a plus, prior experience with on-premise builds or architecting on other platforms is also a valuble skillset for this role.

As well as spending time working directly with customers, you’ll also get plenty of time to “sharpen the saw” and keep your skills fresh. We have more than 175 services across a range of different categories and it’s important that we can help startups take advantages of the right ones. You’ll also play an important role as an advocate with our product teams to make sure we are building the right products and features for the startups you work with. And for the customers you don’t get to work with on a 1:1 basis you’ll share knowledge more broadly by working on technical content and presenting at events.

About the Team:
The AWS Startup Solutions Architecture team is dedicated to working with these early stage startup companies as they build their businesses. We’re here to make sure that they can deploy the best, most scalable, and most secure architectures possible – and that they spend as little time and money as possible doing so.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have twelve employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded professional and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.


In addition to broad technical depth, expertise in at least one domain: e.g., DevOps, Data & Analytics, Machine Learning, Serverless Computing etc.
Intermediate or advanced experience architecting/operating solutions built on AWS
Intermediate or advanced experience architecting/operating solutions built on-premise or on other cloud platforms

We're seeking Engineers
who are passionate about technology
who are excited to learn new things
that are independent
that work well with others
who will join our small team in NYC!
What is it like being a Software Engineer at OkCupid?
The OkCupid backend engineering team of about a dozen engineers builds the infrastructure that powers matching algorithms, messaging, and more for millions of users every day. Because the team is so small relative to our user base, each engineer here has full ownership of what they're working on and the opportunity to have a considerable amount of direct consumer impact. We also have a lot of input into both technical and product design. We are involved in all parts of the process, from ideation to deployment, so everything we build is something we also had a hand in designing.
Since our team size is lean, each of us has the opportunity to be exposed to many different parts of our stack and learn a ton. To give one concrete example, one backend engineer has in the past year alone: built the foundation of our anti-spam infrastructure, built out the backend support for a completely new messaging paradigm, and made the foundation of our machine learning infrastructure.
We work closely with the other engineering and product teams across the company to figure out the best ways to help people find meaningful relationships and turn those ideas into live product features. These changes include adding brand-new features and experiences to the site. We tweak our matching algorithm to ensure that users see the best possible matches or improve our infrastructure to ensure that users can always find matches and continue moving quickly and improving their experience.
Some things you'll do:
Analyze site activity and user behavior to figure out what makes people click
Work with product and engineering teams to figure out the best ways to help our users find love.
Design, implement and deploy features and improvements based on these findings.
Some examples of projects that backend engineers are currently or were recently working on:
Discovery: building a new site experience to help users find other users based on shared interests, question answers, etc.
Matching algorithm: optimizing the algorithms that decide whom users see in different places across the site
ML infrastructure: building out infrastructure to allow our engineers and data scientists to quickly and easily deploy newly trained machine learning models into production
Core infrastructure: designing the future foundation of OkCupid's backend infrastructure, from deployments to testing environments to monitoring and alerting

About the job
A problem isn’t truly solved until it’s solved for all. That’s why Googlers build products that help create opportunities for everyone, whether down the street or across the globe. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you’ll use your technical expertise to lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects from start to finish. You’ll work with stakeholders to plan requirements, identify risks, manage project schedules, and communicate clearly with cross-functional partners across the company.

You will join a multi-disciplinary team with projects beyond chemical sensing that collaborates cross-functionally, and with several external organizations. You will be responsible for advising and managing the blend of internal versus external investment, and how it changes over time.
Research happens at Google everyday, on many different embedded teams throughout the company. Our research reaches the user through both services and products such as Search, Maps, Google Assistant, Google Translate, Google Cloud and our computing, storage, and networking infrastructure.

MeetElise is on a mission to revolutionize the housing industry, with the ultimate goal of making good housing more accessible.

Access to affordable housing isn't just a problem - it's a global crisis. An estimated seven million affordable and available rental homes are needed in just the US alone, and no amount of government spending or policy have proven to be effective solutions.

MeetElise uses machine learning to address the underlying cause preventing significant advancements in affordable housing: operational costs. By automating the leasing and management of apartment homes, we're creating a new, low cost operating model that allows for the development of new housing at scale.

Our first product is an AI leasing agent named Elise that converts 65% more prospective renters to residents than a human leasing agent. She answers questions and schedules tours 24/7 and is so human-like that renters say they're ""here to meet Elise"" when they show up for a tour.

MeetElise is well-funded by VCs, strategic real estate investors, and customers and was started by technical cofounders from MIT and the University of Cambridge.

Our small, courageous team is building the future we want to live in. A future where housing is affordable, powered by technology, and accessible to all.

About The Role

Sometimes clients have questions about how MeetElise works, need a configuration change or would like to report an issue with our product.

When they contact us their expectations are high: they want prompt, courteous service that quickly resolves their issue.

But our systems are complex, each client has their own configuration and working with an AI-powered virtual leasing assistant is a new concept. Sometimes issues can take multiple days and involve multiple teams to fully solve.

Support specialists remove the complexity for our customers. They understand every detail of our systems, know where to find configuration information and are quickly able to find a resolution or provide key information to customers.

In addition to being technical problem solvers they're also adept communicators, able to manage customer expectations while delivering crystal clear communication that takes the sting out of any issues a customer is experiencing.

Through diligent problem solving, exceptional prioritization and super consistent communication Support Specialists turn negatives into positives and clients into advocates for MeetElise.

We’ve just announced a $35 million Series B financing round led by Eldridge (alongside existing investors Index Ventures, Sussex Place Ventures, and Contour Ventures) and we’re thrilled to be embarking on our next exciting chapters of growth.

What does this role mean to us?

Moving into 2022 we will be doubling headcount within our product & engineering teams, and moving into developing for the Tech vertical as well as supporting our existing customers which include some of the biggest names in Finance.

As an Agile Delivery Manager, you will help our product & engineering org work cross-functionally and collaboratively as we journey through this next stage of growth.

Being a startup (albeit one that’s growing quickly) - we are looking for that balance between player & coach, so facilitating positive outcomes, driving change, and leading with empathy are really important but rolling up your sleeves and getting into the thick of things (across the software development lifecycle) are equally as critical.

We would love to have conversations with scrum masters, agile delivery managers, delivery managers, delivery leads, agile coaches, technical project managers & more.

What will you be doing as our Agile Delivery Manager?

Own and help refine our ways of working processes within a squad(s) to optimise for flow - e.g leading retros, planning, stand-ups & sprint reviews
Coordinating between key stakeholders, product managers, engineering, and QA engineers in the pursuit of getting code into the hands of our users on time
Own key decision points around adjustments to release schedules for your squad, e.g owning the delivery roadmap
Encourage transparency and ensure communication is broadcast when changes / risks / challenges are happening within the squad
Work closely with your tech lead & product manager to form a strong squad leadership model with your focus being on software delivery & enablement
Making the day to day experience for our engineers easier and reduce the number of distractions & limit context switching as much as possible from fixing blockers to having difficult (but polite) conversations with external stakeholders where necessary

What we’d like you to bring to the table…

Some experience in an agile environment - we loosely adopt scrum & kanban today
Ability to navigate & mitigate risks / dependencies for your squad
A good communicator, experienced with working with a range of stakeholders including product managers, engineers, and designers.
A fair understanding of the entire product delivery process, from ideation to delivery
You consider yourself a lifelong learner, inspiring those around you to gain a better understanding of everything related to software product development.
A delivery orientated mind-set, we are not looking for a pure hands off scrum master, we need someone who wants to get into the detail, the context, & the platform itself (Cutover) & own the features that your squad(s) build.

The good stuff...

You’ll be given a solid compensation plan. We want all of our team members to feel a genuine sense of ownership in what we're building here at Cutover. We're excited to offer Share Options as part of our compensation package.
25 days paid holiday per year + Federal Holidays, and we want you to take all of them!
We believe in a flexible, autonomous way of working. We provide work from home stipends, and we have built a trusting environment together: do great work, and build an office+home schedule that suits your scenario.
We’re committed to covering a bulk of the total cost of health insurance with company-funded employee Private Medical Insurance via Vitality.
A personal learning and development budget through Learnerbly.
If you’re thinking of starting or growing your family, then you’ll be in great company - more than half of our team are parents and we’ve built a globally consistent parental leave approach that we’re proud of.

We're seeking Engineers
who are passionate about technology
who are excited to learn new things
that are independent
that work well with others
who will join our small team in NYC!
What is it like being a Software Engineer at OkCupid?
The OkCupid backend engineering team of about a dozen engineers builds the infrastructure that powers matching algorithms, messaging, and more for millions of users every day. Because the team is so small relative to our user base, each engineer here has full ownership of what they're working on and the opportunity to have a considerable amount of direct consumer impact. We also have a lot of input into both technical and product design. We are involved in all parts of the process, from ideation to deployment, so everything we build is something we also had a hand in designing.
Since our team size is lean, each of us has the opportunity to be exposed to many different parts of our stack and learn a ton. To give one concrete example, one backend engineer has in the past year alone: built the foundation of our anti-spam infrastructure, built out the backend support for a completely new messaging paradigm, and made the foundation of our machine learning infrastructure.
We work closely with the other engineering and product teams across the company to figure out the best ways to help people find meaningful relationships and turn those ideas into live product features. These changes include adding brand-new features and experiences to the site. We tweak our matching algorithm to ensure that users see the best possible matches or improve our infrastructure to ensure that users can always find matches and continue moving quickly and improving their experience.
Some things you'll do:
Analyze site activity and user behavior to figure out what makes people click
Work with product and engineering teams to figure out the best ways to help our users find love.
Design, implement and deploy features and improvements based on these findings.
Some examples of projects that backend engineers are currently or were recently working on:
Discovery: building a new site experience to help users find other users based on shared interests, question answers, etc.
Matching algorithm: optimizing the algorithms that decide whom users see in different places across the site
ML infrastructure: building out infrastructure to allow our engineers and data scientists to quickly and easily deploy newly trained machine learning models into production
Core infrastructure: designing the future foundation of OkCupid's backend infrastructure, from deployments to testing environments to monitoring and alerting

We’re looking for a strong QA Engineer to help us ensure a high standard of quality and reliability for Runway's video editing suite.

About the company
Runway is building the next generation of creative tools. We are a small team of artists, engineers, developers, and researchers working together to predict-by-inventing the future. Our team members used to work at NYU, Disney Research, IBM Research, Linode, and Stanford.
We've built a tool that makes machine learning easy and accessible for all types of creatives. And our users love it. But our vision is bigger. We are transforming how content and media is created. For decades, media creation has relied on incremental iterations of the same old tools. And while some of those tools have become smarter in recent years, they're still very much rooted in an outdated paradigm. We've been stuck with the same old Creative Suite for way too long. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will not just bring automation at every scale, but a significant change in how we create. That's why Runway is reimagining how we create, so we can create new things.

Runway has an active and growing community of artists and creators all over the world. IBM, Google, R/GA, New Balance, Chanel, and dozen of companies are using Runway to create and explore new creative boundaries. Runway is also used to teach at a wide variety of institutions. From architectural programs at MIT to self-organized independent workshops in Perú.

Grid.ai enables companies of all sizes to train state-of-the-art AI models on hundreds of cloud GPUs and TPUs from their laptops. From the creator of the popular framework PyTorch Lightning, Grid is a platform for training models that enables rapid research iteration. Grid aims to simplify scalable AI research so that when a network becomes complex, code doesn't.

Focus on Machine Learning, Not Infrastructure.

Grid.ai is backed by $18.6 million in funding from Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Firstminute. Grid is a remote-first company founded by William Falcon and Luis Capelo.

What's important to us

We are building a company of people that care deeply about the impact of AI on our society. We value:

Integrity: AI is bound to change how we interact with computers, with each other, and the world—for the better. We are committed to building an inclusive company and developing ethical AI that improves humanity.
Perseverance: Be bold, take the initiative, and make decisions with confidence. We empower our community, clients, and colleagues to tackle the impossible.
Curiosity: We are genuinely interested in finding solutions to advance the state of AI research and foster its application in novel products. It's not about whether we can solve the problem, but how.
We also feel that it's essential to point out the self-evident here – there's a genuine lack of diversity in our industry, which has to change. One of our goals is to help drive that change. Grid.ai is fully committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in all of its practices, especially when it comes to growing our team. Our culture promotes inclusion, and we embrace how rewarding it is to work with people from all walks of life.
What we're looking for

We are looking for a Solutions Architect with expertise in machine learning and distributed systems to serve as the technical liaison to qualify and close opportunities with customers and partners. You will report to Robert Lee, our Head of Sales Engineering, and work closely with Armen Kopoyan, our Head of Sales, Alex Cort, our Business Development Manager, and the product team.

This is a chance for you to help bring groundbreaking technology that will transform the machine learning ecosystem to market!

What you'll do
Become a product expert with an in-depth understanding of target markets, value proposition, user personas, and pricing models.
Introduce customers to Grid's core product offering and educate each potential client on the platform's unique capabilities based on their business needs.
Lead product and solution briefings, build proof-of-concepts (POC), run live product demos, and prototype Grid integrations while identifying and addressing key technical objections.
Define and execute engineering strategies to resolve blockers to adoption and utilization.
Build a technical feedback loop between potential customers and Grid's sales, customer success, product, and marketing teams to inform the product roadmap with key information about requested features and client challenges.

Bowery builds smart indoor farms near cities, growing fresher, pesticide-free Protected Produce with bold flavor in precisely controlled environments, 365 days a year. At the heart of each farm is the proprietary BoweryOS, which integrates software, hardware, sensors, AI, computer vision systems, machine learning models and robotics to orchestrate and automate the entirety of its operations. As a result, each farm creates far less waste and uses a fraction of the water and land compared to traditional agriculture.

About The Role:
Data Science at Bowery means building production-facing data products which automate the agricultural and operational functions in our network of indoor vertical farms. The Data & AI function at Bowery is central to the vision of the company as well as its day to day operation. You’ll work with our team of data scientists and analysts as well as agricultural scientists and supply chain managers who bring domain expertise to our data-driven solutions.
What You'll Do:
You’ll create innovative quantitative solutions and advance the state of indoor farming alongside mechanical engineers, agricultural scientists, and the farm operations team.
You'll combine agricultural considerations with production demands to maximize plant growth and fulfillment probability.
You’ll optimize work and production schedules to achieve the highest utilization of grow time and space in the farm.
You’ll use the key drivers of Bowery's business and agricultural science to design experimental frameworks to ensure data integrity and empower us to more easily analyze and act upon data from new trials.
You'll analyze historical data related to crop growth and environmental characteristics to forecast yields for future harvests and uncover insights about ways conditions can be optimized.
You'll help shape the way our data science team does work - researching and making key decisions about what we build, how we build it, and which tools are best for solving our problems.
You'll work alongside software engineers to implement data processing and visualization systems that make data readily available and simplify how insights are communicated.
You won’t target ads, optimize signup funnels, or recommend anything for anyone to click on.
Who You Are:
You have a strong mathematical background in probability, statistics, and optimization algorithms.
You are fluent in Python and enjoy building software the team can depend on.
You are proficient with SQL and can work “full stack” to integrate solutions with our data ecosystem.
You have a deep understanding of and have applied various machine learning techniques for solving real-world problems.
You are energized by translating business, operations, and agricultural questions into data science problems, solving those problems, and interpreting the output back into clear outcomes.
You are confident in taking ownership of projects from start to finish and enjoy the process of turning nebulous ideas into reality.
Who We Are:
Bowery is a place where everyone is welcome, included and empowered to reach their full potential.
We live our shared values every day in both big and small ways: opt-in, think wildly different, break barriers together & be kind to the core We are a mission-driven team of unconventional thinkers, problem-solvers, optimists and activators.

We are excited to hear from you!

newSenior Frontend Engineer,Cutover,"New York, NY•Remote",None,None,Posted3 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=feb0fc77c6833015&fccid=2694952c5d906dc5&vjs=3,"At Cutover, we’re focused on helping Enterprise teams move quickly with confidence, so we’ve built the world’s first enterprise-wide work orchestration and observability platform that enables seamless human and machine collaboration. We’ve just announced a $35 million Series B financing round led by Eldridge (alongside existing investors Index Ventures, Sussex Place Ventures and Contour Ventures) and we’re thrilled to be embarking on our next exciting chapters of growth.

What will this role entail?
We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our brand new squad focused on operational resilience. We’d love to find a talented, passionate, front-end focused engineer who is excited to take responsibility for a broad array of our future technology plans. You’ll also be working alongside a distributed squad of engineers based in both the US and UK.

What tech stack do we have here at Cutover?

Our Cutover Enterprise platform consists of a responsive AngularJS (and increasingly React) frontend talking to a Ruby on Rails API, hosted on Amazon Web Services. Our automated testing is done using Jest and Jasmine (and RSpec for the Backend), with Selenium being used for end-to-end testing.

What we’d like you to bring to the table…

You’re likely a JavaScript/TypeScript engineer who’s passionate about modern front-end frameworks; you can demonstrate that you've worked on interesting front-end and/or full-stack projects, ideally for modern SaaS businesses.
You’re excited about bringing extra layers of shine and polish to products; you’re rigorous in the way you test features and you’re committed to making the product you’re building the best it can be (you’ll be someone who aims to build strong relationships with Test Engineers from day one).
You’re both a mentor and a lifelong-learner at heart: you always have time to chat things through with junior engineers and interns, you want to throw ideas around with your team-mates, and you’re always keen to hear new opinions and up-skill in new technologies.
You have a desire to be more “commercial” than the average SaaS company engineer: we want our engineers to get involved with client-facing work and problem-solving on occasion (it makes sense to know how people are using the platform we’ve built, right?).

What will your adventure here look like?

Helping us to develop, test, and ship at pace.
Encouraging and readily giving and receiving feedback to help your team, manager, and wider stakeholders.
Working cross-functionally with product and design to discover and build solutions that are scalable and performant.
Prioritising best practices, keeping everything you do up-to-date, secure and compliant by default; recommending approaches, and providing timeline estimates.
Developing a deep understanding of our product and its customer base.
Forging the next step in your career journey, taking advantage of every learning opportunity that comes along!

The good stuff…

We want all of our team members to feel a genuine sense of ownership in what we're building here at Cutover. We're excited to offer Share Options as part of our compensation package.
20 days vacation allowance + federal holidays, and we want you to take all of them!
We believe in a flexible, autonomous way of working. We provide work from home stipends, and we have built a trusting environment together: do great work, and build an office+home schedule that suits your scenario.
A top-tier private health insurance package.
401k or pension contribution depending on which location you are based in.
A personal learning and development budget through Learnerbly.
Employee Referral Scheme
All the company swag you could ever need.
If you’re thinking of starting or growing your family, then you’ll be in great company - more than half of our team are parents and we’ve built a globally consistent parental leave approach that we’re proud of.
Safeguarding the mental health of our teams is paramount for us. If you’d like to, then you’ll be able to avail yourself of multiple Cutover mental health initiatives, from fully subsidized therapy sessions to subscriptions to leading wellbeing platforms.

Interviewing with us

Through our interview process, we aim for you to hear more about the challenges we work on and the problems we look to solve; to give you a great experience while meeting our team; and to ensure you leave with a good understanding of life here at Cutover!

Over three steps via Zoom, you'll be meeting a member of our People team, future teammates, and two of our senior leadership team in engineering. We're not fans of take-home exercises and we won't ask you to spend any time outside of interviews on this."

More than 5 million ""community philanthropists"" have supported such projects, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 40 million students nationwide. In all, we've generated $1 billion for learning experiences designed by our country's most dedicated public school teachers.

With the explosion of information and data online, search has never been more important. However, while the world of consumer search has innovated over time, enterprise search has not. In fact, the majority of enterprise search is powered by outdated keyword technology that only scans for keywords and delivers a list of hyperlinks rather than actually answering questions. Yext, the AI Search Company, offers a modern, AI-powered Answers Platform that understands natural language so that when people ask questions about a business online they get direct answers – not links.

We have a big, audacious mission to transform the enterprise with AI search. To achieve that, we need bright minds and diverse perspectives to join our growing company and help us continue to disrupt an industry. Does this sound like you?
As a Data Scientist you will shape how data is collected, transformed, and leveraged to develop essential new capabilities and features for Yext's products. We manage large amounts of structured master data on behalf of some of the world's largest companies and collect transactional data through end-user-facing applications we host directly for these clients. Our mission revolves around deeply understanding user intent so we can deliver relevant and accurate answers to questions, everywhere people search.

Yext clients cover a tremendous breadth of industries. We are seeking data scientists excited to discover opportunities in data across a wide variety of business domains. You will work collaboratively with cross-team partners in software engineering, product management, and strategy. This approach will allow you to participate fully in the product development lifecycle and make pragmatic decisions about the design, training, and deployment of machine learning models driving key product features.

What You'll Do

Partner with product management and engineering teams throughout the product development lifecycle
Solve ""full stack"" Data Science problems – Implement solutions to a data science problem in a production environment, coping with all the challenges (such as data cleanliness, performance, unexpected feedback loops, and concept drift) that arise
Articulate Data Science and machine learning concepts to a variety of audiences (product managers, software engineers, executives, sales partners)
Dive deep into the details when called for while demonstrating good judgement about when to simplify and prioritize

What You Have

Advanced degree in a quantitative discipline, e.g., computer science, mathematics, business analytics, statistics, applied mathematics, economics, or operations research
Autodidactic, Self directed – You are able to dive into a new unfamiliar problem domain and start learning about it – You are comfortable with uncertainty and project evolution
Effective communicator, a good writer, and know effective means of visually displaying quantitative information
Fluency with data analysis software and tools such as Python and SQL
Exceptional multi-tasking skills

Bonus Points

Experience with JVM languages (Java, Scala) a plus. GoLang or C++ also great!
Experience with AWS, Linux and Mac environments
Excellent ability to cope with ""glue"" problems - shell scripting, debugging python environment problems, fixing broken packages
Knowledge of Python or R, and the machine learning, data processing and visualization packages (e.g. Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
Knowledge of SQL and databases like MySQL, Postgres, Presto and Hive.
Knowledge of neural network packages (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and state-of-the-art transformer/NLP models and techniques (e.g. FastText, BERT, et al.)

Knowledge of techniques in unsupervised machine learning and information retrieval and mining (e.g. DBSCAN, k-Means, indexes)

We’re looking for a strong Frontend Engineer to help us build new interfaces for content creation. The best fit for this role has an eye for good design and smooth interactivity, strives to write clean and maintainable code, and has a deep interest in the future of creative tools and browser technologies. You’ll be working closely with our design team as well as the backend team to implement new features for the Runway application, as well as participating in user research sessions to understand how Runway is being used by creators across the world.
This is a full-time role. We are based in New York, but welcome remote applications from everywhere
About the company
Runway is building the next generation of creative tools. We are a small team of artists, engineers, developers, and researchers working together to predict-by-inventing the future. Our team members used to work at NYU, Disney Research, IBM Research, Linode, and Stanford.
We've built a tool that makes machine learning easy and accessible for all types of creatives. And our users love it. But our vision is bigger. We are transforming how content and media is created. For decades, media creation has relied on incremental iterations of the same old tools. And while some of those tools have become smarter in recent years, they're still very much rooted in an outdated paradigm. We've been stuck with the same old Creative Suite for way too long. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will not just bring automation at every scale, but a significant change in how we create. That's why Runway is reimagining how we create, so we can create new things.

Runway has an active and growing community of artists and creators all over the world. IBM, Google, R/GA, New Balance, Chanel, and dozen of companies are using Runway to create and explore new creative boundaries. Runway is also used to teach at a wide variety of institutions. From architectural programs at MIT to self-organized independent workshops in Perú.
We are a young company and this role is a unique opportunity to join a market-defining company in its early stages.

Expertise in building robust and accessible web interfaces.

Our customers see odds, lines, spreads, play-by-play updates, deposits, and withdrawals.

We see only data, data, data, data, data, and data. Each contest generates tens of millions of individual data points that have to be collected, combined, understood, and acted on. All at the speed of the game. No time-outs.

Our customers see odds, lines, spreads, play-by-play updates, deposits, and withdrawals.

We see only data, data, data, data, data, and data. Each contest generates tens of millions of individual data points that have to be collected, combined, understood, and acted on. All at the speed of the game. No time-outs.

Citizen is the No. 1 public safety app in the U.S., with a mission to make the world a safer place. Citizen provides 911 alerts so people can use their phones to keep themselves, and the people and places they love, safe.

Roku is changing how the world watches TV

Roku is the #1 TV streaming platform in the U.S., and we've set our sights on powering every television in the world. Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.


From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable — and valued — contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world, while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.

About the team

At Roku, the Data Science team lives and works on a kind of frontier: We get called in for things that haven't been done before. This requires meaningful collaboration with the platform team, the firmware team and even the finance team to prove or disprove new product ideas. Often the idea evolves from what was first proposed until it is a wholly new thing that gets shipped. No one here is ashamed to present their latest work, and you'll find yourself pitching ideas to others in the company, including to executives.


Beyond collaboration, we seek builders with the persistence to keep pushing. Because we spend our time making prototypes and testing brand new ideas on systems with a lot of moving parts, we are faced with failures every day. The only way to really make something work is to really dig into the reasons and understand why. We value the grit and persistence it takes to keep just trying.

About the role

Roku pioneered TV streaming and continues to innovate and lead the industry. The Roku Channel has us well-positioned to help shape the future of streaming. Continued success relies on investing in Data Science and diving deep into the economics of our business.


This role is right for you if you enjoy diving into messy data, cleaning it up, finding powerful insights, presenting them in a compelling way, developing models and then working closely with software engineers to automate this process, to prove it out at scale. You should also relish the ability to influence the direction of the team's strategic goals, question the inherent assumptions in our thinking, and defining the business objectives in an innovative and encouraging environment.


The ideal candidate will have endless curiosity and can pair a global mindset with locally relevant execution. You should be a gritty problem solver and self-starter who can drive programs with the product and commercial teams within Roku and across external strategic partner organizations. The successful candidate will display a balance of hard and soft skills, including the ability to respond quickly to changing business needs.

What you'll be doing
Develop data science algorithms to improve user experience on Roku's platform.
Develop economic models (e.g., market design, pricing, program evaluation, and forecasting) to better understand the user experience on Roku's platform.
Run live experiments to prototype the improvements and prove their efficacy.
Dive into data, clean it up, and pull-out insights that can be used to improve system performance and present to senior leaders with recommendations on business actions.
Assist the development team with productization of successful algorithms, ensuring your work continues to drive value at scale.
Provide expert consultative assistance to other teams in the company, including data scientists working in other areas of Roku's stack and provide technical feedback on their econometric work.
Contribute to the technical vision of the Data Science team.
We're excited if you have
PhD Degree
6 yrs + of experience post PhD in Machine Learning, Operations Research, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, or similar quantitative field.
Experience in causal Machine Learning and experimentation.
Proven problem solving and analytical abilities.
Software development skills in Python, Java, Julia or Scala.
Proficiency with analysis tools such as Spark, R, MATLAB or similar.
Experience with TB or PB size datasets preferred.
Nice-to-have's include knowledge of user behavior in subscription and advertising-based video, auctions and/or advertising.
The Roku culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.


We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Software Engineer: Experienced,Jane Street,"New York, NY",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=b95db83c8aadc5b2&fccid=0e38ef958e252f1e&vjs=3,"About the Position

We're always hiring software engineers for all three of our offices. Technology is at the core of how we approach our work, and engineers are intimately tied in to every area of the business.

We are big believers in functional programming, using OCaml, a statically-typed functional programming language, as our primary development language. We also believe in the value of open source software, using it in our daily work and releasing hundreds of thousands of lines of our own code as open source.

About You
Top-notch programming skills
Deep experience with - and love for - technology. There's no specific checklist; we use software to approach a variety of problems, so we're interested in everything from machine learning to systems administration to programming language design
Strong interpersonal skills. Software engineering at Jane Street is highly collaborative, and we are looking for people who can work effectively in small, close-knit teams
Fluency in English required

We don’t expect you to have experience with functional programming, OCaml, or finance; we’re happy to hire talented engineers and teach them what they need to know.

You will improve, iterate, and reimagine the product experience to shape the next generation of analytics tools. You will also partner with a wide variety of internal and external customers to craft a modern, elegant BI experience for one of the fastest growing areas of software.

Location: This role can be located in Bellevue or Redmond, Washington or Minneapolis, Minnesota.

What You Bring
You have an “anything is possible” mindset when faced with highly ambiguous and complex problems. You’re proud of your work, your skills and expertise – but you’re not cynical, inflexible or too proud to take in other perspectives which may bring you new data points and insights that may shift your decisions or perspective if warranted. You love being part of a highly collaborative and high-energy team that isn’t afraid to swing for the fences or exceed expectations even on small projects.

You have a deep background in complex data related products, geek out over customer experience, visualization and machine learning and believe that no experience is perfect unless it delights customers in unexpected ways. You’re also a passionate learner that’s motivated to take on new challenges. You have demonstrated design acumen and believe in the power of strategic design to differentiate experience and increase customer loyalty. You are an influencer who doesn’t hold your ideas as precious and who iterates quickly, based on data, and delivers recommendations and analysis that tell the story of the customer experience we are delivering.

What You Will Do
In this role you will be responsible for leading a variety of design initiatives across the entire product. You will work alongside product management, product/visual/interaction design, and engineering to define and build the essential lovable product. This position requires deep customer focus, the ability to dive deep and invent, and the ability to make hard decisions fast.

We are looking for candidates who thrive in a fast-paced startup like environment. To be successful, you need to be highly motivated and detail oriented while showing highest standards of responsibilities.

Key Responsibilities: - Contribute to the design of new experiences and improvements of existing experiences while planning and defining strategy for the direction of future iterations.

Integrate business requirements, customer feedback, and market research to assist in developing use cases and high-level requirements.
Develop conceptual diagrams, interaction flows, mock-ups, and prototypes to effectively communicate interaction and design ideas.
Deliver work that's not only user-friendly, aesthetically engaging, but which also produces results.
Work alongside engineers and product managers throughout all stages of the production cycle.
Develop and maintain detailed user-interface specifications for developer handoff.
Present design work to multiple teams and senior leadership for review and feedback.
Assess and optimize the performance of new and existing features by actively participating in user research and assessing performance metrics.
Contribute to the group's shared knowledge of user-centered design and research methodologies.

Inclusivity
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded professional and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.


Experience designing user interfaces for data visualization or business intelligence (analytics) products.
Experience working with design systems or visual design style guides.
Experience working directly with developers for implementation of designs.
Ability to work efficiently and demonstrate a bias for action in a fast-paced, ambiguous environment.
Excellent communication, interpersonal, and analytical skills, including the ability to present design concepts clearly and persuasively to colleagues, partners, stakeholders, and especially to senior executives.

Hux is the Human Experience Platform by Deloitte Digital. We help companies connect key data sources to understand what matters most to people; connect to advanced technologies like AI and machine learning to sense and respond to those needs at scale; and connect their systems to unlock insights, create collaboration and drive acquisition, engagement and loyalty. Most importantly, we empower companies to connect with customers in personal, meaningful ways that respect them as people, not just customers.

Machine Learning Engineer,Runway AI,"New York, NY",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=5b1c0366f01b20db&fccid=8375224c1881aba2&vjs=3,"About the role
At Runway, we’re building a next-generation creative tool that enables a new level of interactivity with cloud-based machine learning models. For our tool to be maximally expressive, it needs to establish a seamless feedback loop between its users and the machine learning models powering its abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible.
For this reason, we’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can help us create the server-side engine that powers our interactive tools for image and video synthesis. You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments. The best fit for the role is someone who is deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems design, and has extensive experience building web-based real-time server applications.
This is a full-time role. We are based in New York, but welcome remote applications from everywhere
About the company
Runway is building the next generation of creative tools. We are a small team of artists, engineers, developers, and researchers working together to predict-by-inventing the future. Our team members used to work at NYU, Disney Research, IBM Research, Linode, and Stanford.
We have built a tool that makes machine learning easy and accessible for all types of creatives. And our users love it. But our vision is bigger. We are transforming how content and media is created. For decades, media creation has relied on incremental iterations of the same old tools. And while some of those tools have become smarter in recent years, they're still very much rooted in an outdated paradigm. We've been stuck with the same old Creative Suite for way too long. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will not just bring automation at every scale, but a significant change in how we create. That's why Runway is reimagining how we create, so we can create new things.

Runway has an active and growing community of artists and creators all over the world. IBM, Google, R/GA, New Balance, Chanel, and dozen of companies are using Runway to create and explore new creative boundaries. Runway is also used to teach at a wide variety of institutions. From architectural programs at MIT to self-organized independent workshops in Perú.
We are a young company and this role is a unique opportunity to join a market-defining company in its early stages.
Requirements:
Solid knowledge of at least one machine learning research framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), and at least one high-performance inference framework (e.g. TensorRT, Apache TVM).
Experience profiling and optimizing deep neural networks, including knowledge of GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight.
Familiarity with Python-based image and video manipulation/encoding/decoding frameworks, such as OpenCV and PyAV.
Experience with cloud orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.
Opinionated about writing robust and maintainable client-server architectures and APIs.
Ability to rapidly prototype solutions and iterate on them with tight product deadlines.
Strong communication, collaboration, and documentation skills."

Sidewalk Labs is an urban innovation company that tackles cities' greatest challenges. We create products and solutions, invest in new companies, and help developers build more sustainable, innovative, and equitable places around the world. Our ambitious vision requires us to push ourselves beyond conventional thinking, and we work hard in pursuit of our mission. Our cross-disciplinary team consists of experts from real estate, urban planning, government, finance, technology, and engineering, among other backgrounds.

Our urban innovations include Delve (a generative design product that empowers real estate teams to design better, faster, with less risk), Mesa (an easy-install kit for commercial buildings that cuts energy costs, improves tenant comfort, and simplifies building operations), Pebble (a low-cost vehicle sensor to help manage parking and curb space), and Affordable Electrification (a new way to manage home energy use to meet a customer's monthly budget). We're also developing an offsite construction company that can deliver high-quality mass timber buildings for more sustainable living and working.

With the potential to radically improve quality of life in cities for all, our work is both exciting and complex. We are working to achieve something unprecedented — help us build it!
What is the role?

To significantly improve sustainability in cities, Sidewalk Labs is developing new technology that will drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to the status quo, enable smarter management of resources, and reduce the cost of future upgrades and maintenance.

We are looking for initiative-taking Machine Learning Software Engineers to join our development of Mesa, our affordable energy-saving offering for commercial real estate (more on the product here). Your first project will be building machine learning software that ingests large and diverse data sets from buildings, aids in reducing energy use, and enables intelligent management of buildings through sensors and connected infrastructure .

It's a bonus (but not a requirement) if you are familiar with building systems and IoT sensors, their data, and analysis of it (e.g., HVAC, occupancy, temperature, electric loads etc.).

What is required is a passion for sustainability to reduce the world's emissions, affordably.

We encourage engineers of all experience levels to apply, and will determine your level within Sidewalk Labs based on interview performance.

Note: We are currently working remotely, and we expect to eventually re-open our offices when it is safe to return, in 2021. After re-opening, candidates will be expected to come into the New York office.

What you will achieve :

Within your first few months, you should have:
Built a deep understanding of the team's current initiatives and technology infrastructure (Python and Typescript running on the Google Cloud Platform), coding style and standards.
Familiarized yourself with our current ML pipeline.
Contributed code to the repository.
From there your role will continue to develop and change over time. We are a small team working on an early stage product. Future projects may include:
Work with building energy experts to develop, test, and evaluate new control algorithms to improve buildings' energy efficiency and surface operational insights.
Build tools and systems to scale deployment of models and pipelines.
Develop models and systems to detect problems or anomalies in buildings and surface them to users.

What we expect:

Know your software engineering.
Have a strong CS background in order to choose the right algorithms, systems approaches and patterns to solve problems, without reinventing the wheel.
Candidates need to be able to hit the ground running. Therefore, for this role we are looking for 2+ years of industry experience.
Experience with Python and frameworks such as Numpy and Pandas. , plus at least one systems programming language (Python, C++, Java, or Go).
Experience building and owning machine learning pipelines end-to-end. Bonus points for:
Work on optimizing the built environment.
Experience with HVAC or IoT systems
Act as a technologist.
Bias towards action and shipping. Once you've sketched out an idea, you find the fastest path to a prototype to prove the concept.
Strong ability to write production code quickly.
You are obsessed with privacy and constantly ask how we can build privacy into product design.
Be comfortable with a range of languages and open source tools and frameworks, and make good decisions about which to use to solve a particular problem. You are excited to learn something new when the need arises.
Solve problems, together.
Come up with novel solutions, working well with technologists and non-technologists alike.
Ask hard questions and challenge assumptions to ensure that we're solving the right problems.
Have flexibility to work on the team's most pressing problems.
Care.
About cities, solving hard problems, and our team's success.
You are committed to creating more equitable and inclusive outcomes both in the workplace and in the work you do.

Are you a machine learning engineer interested in Sidewalk Labs, but are not sure this is the right role for you? No worries, please apply to our generalist position here. All applicants will be considered for any open position on our teams.
We are very excited to hear from you.

Sidewalk Labs is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We actively seek applicants from underrepresented communities. Even if you are not 100% sure you are right for the role, please apply and we will be happy to consider your application. All employment is based on merit and business need, and we respond to each application we receive."

Senior Developer Advocate - AI & Machine Learning,Grid.ai,New York State•Remote,3.9,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=1a1bc359f32dbcc6&fccid=b5934b25d4f47666&vjs=3,"Who we are

Grid.ai enables companies of all sizes to train state-of-the-art AI models on hundreds of cloud GPUs and TPUs from their laptops. From the creator of the popular framework PyTorch Lightning, Grid is a platform for training models that enables rapid research iteration. Grid aims to simplify scalable AI research so that when a network becomes complex, code doesn't.

Focus on Machine Learning, Not Infrastructure.

Grid.ai is backed by $18.6 million in funding from Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Firstminute. Grid is a remote-first company founded by William Falcon and Luis Capelo.

What's important to us

We are building a company of people that care deeply about the impact of AI on our society. We value:

Integrity: AI is bound to change how we interact with computers, with each other, and the world—for the better. We are committed to building an inclusive company and developing ethical AI that improves humanity.
Perseverance: Be bold, take the initiative, and make decisions with confidence. We empower our community, clients, and colleagues to tackle the impossible.
Curiosity: We are genuinely interested in finding solutions to advance the state of AI research and foster its application in novel products. It's not about whether we can solve the problem, but how.
We also feel that it's essential to point out the self-evident here – there's a genuine lack of diversity in our industry, which has to change. One of our goals is to help drive that change. Grid.ai is fully committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in all of its practices, especially when it comes to growing our team. Our culture promotes inclusion, and we embrace how rewarding it is to work with people from all walks of life.
What We're Looking For

As more developers use Grid and Lightning, we are actively investing in our user communities. This is an opportunity for you to shape the developer experience in the AI space while driving the adoption and utilization of technology that will transform the machine learning ecosystem as a whole. At Grid.ai, developer advocacy centers around 3 tenants:

Community: Our goal is to amplify the community's voice within the company by increasing engagement, gathering feedback, and working together.
Content: From writing blog posts, drafting articles, and producing videos to building demos and developing our documentation, we want to ensure that our users have the resources they need to get started and learn about the latest ways to use Grid and Lightning!
Engineering: At the end of the day, we are all engineers. We connect with developers in the field, foster strong relationships with internal teams, and work together on prioritizing feedback to inform discovery and roadmap development.
What You'll Do
Amplify the Lightning and Grid Community by connecting with users in the community Slack, speaking at meetups and conferences, and hosting Community Office Hours and Technical Community Sprints.
Launch the first Grid and Lightning Ambassadors Program to foster community and create champions for our products.
Write technical content and documentation, including open source repos, blog posts, case studies, and documentation to enable engineers, scientists, and researchers to do more with Grid and Lightning.
Collaborate with the product and engineering teams to share the voice of the community and improve the developer experience as a whole.
Actively build demos on top of lightning using PyTorch, Lightning, and Grid.
Represent the company at conferences and meetups virtually (and across the globe when it's safe) to connect with our community, meet our users, and host fun, engaging events.
How we evaluate your candidacy

Our interviews will not only give us insight into your skillset but give you insight into our company.

Recruiter Interview - 15 minutes: You will speak with our recruiter about your background and what you are looking for in your next role. We want to know why you are interested in joining us and what questions you have about the team.
Hiring Manager Interview - 45 minutes: You will speak to our Head of Developer Advocacy and chat about your genuine passion for AI and machine learning, as well as your unique approach to the Advocacy Role. You will share your thoughts on connecting with end-users, gathering feedback, and creating champions within our community.
Virtual Onsite - 3 hours: You'll have the opportunity to meet with our Head of Developer Advocacy, as well as a product manager, marketing specialist, and software engineer for 30-45 minutes each and work through exercises spanning community building, technical content creation, culture, and NLP, Computer Vision, or Audio Processing Tasks. You will also meet our CEO, William Falcon, to chat about your background, what you've learned, and why you'd like to work with us.
Offer: We try our best to give you a decision within 24 hours of each interview. At this point, we will present our offer and provide additional context about our stock options and growth trajectory.
Start Date: Given our early stage, we would like all of our new hires to start within 4 weeks of acceptance.

About the job
A problem isn’t truly solved until it’s solved for all. That’s why Googlers build products that help create opportunities for everyone, whether down the street or across the globe. As a Technical Program Manager at Google, you’ll use your technical expertise to lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects from start to finish. You’ll work with stakeholders to plan requirements, identify risks, manage project schedules, and communicate clearly with cross-functional partners across the company. You're equally comfortable explaining your team's analyses and recommendations to executives as you are discussing the technical tradeoffs in product development with engineers.

Our goal is to build a Google that looks like the world around us — and we want Googlers to stay and grow when they join us. As part of our efforts to build a Google for everyone, we build diversity, equity, and inclusion into our work and we aim to cultivate a sense of belonging throughout the company.

In this role, you will focus on developing chemical sensors that replicate olfaction. You will use your knowledge about the scientific fundamentals of chemistry and chemical sensing to make technical and resourcing decisions. You will join a multi-disciplinary team with projects beyond chemical sensing that collaborates cross-functionally, and with several external organizations. You will be responsible for advising and managing the blend of internal versus external investment, and how it changes over time.
Research happens at Google everyday, on many different embedded teams throughout the company. Our research reaches the user through both services and products such as Search, Maps, Google Assistant, Google Translate, Google Cloud and our computing, storage, and networking infrastructure. To achieve this, we’re working on a wide variety of projects that utilize the latest state-of-the-art technologies that push the boundaries of what is possible.
Responsibilities
Engage with and understand the fundamental science underlying sensor technologies and machine learning in chemistry.
Develop high-throughput data collection processes across several data modalities and test benches for technology evaluation.
Manage and influence hardware/software roadmaps.
