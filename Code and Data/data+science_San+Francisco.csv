Today, Awning is a small, well-funded team that is building the next generation real estate investment platform. We are seeking our first data engineer. In this high impact role, you'll lead the development and scaling of our data infrastructure, including our warehouse, our production systems for model deployment, our many-to-many data syncs, and our ETL. You'll also support with data science, machine learning, and engineering work we do.

Set up, maintain, and scale our data warehouse
Define the vision for our machine learning and data infrastructure
Build and maintain our ETL pipeline
Integrate third-party data sources with our data infrastructure

Build ML models to help us better find and analyze great properties

About you:
You love high impact, fast paced roles.
You are a great communicator.
You can manage your own technical roadmap.
You have strong SQL experience and have worked in production Python environments before.
You have brought machine learning models to production.
You have experience with Airflow and Docker or similar.
You are analytical and strong mathematically — doing an analysis on an a/b test or debugging a computer vision model is more exciting than daunting.

Be an Owner: We expect everyone on the team to take on an ownership mentality. A double entendre, being an owner means taking initiative as a part owner of our company and having empathy for our customers, the owners on our platform.
Break New Ground: We value and encourage innovation. Real estate is an archaic industry with very little change — we believe by leading that change ourselves that we can have a meaningful impact on the industry.
We may be a small team, but we believe in building in processes and systems early that can help us scale overtime.
What we offer:
We have a seasoned founding team that understands the importance of our employees to our company's success. As such, Awning offers competitive pay and benefits, including generous equity (we can't expect you to be an owner without treating you like one).
Our benefits and perks include:
Full medical, dental, and vision with optional 70% coverage for dependents

Cash App is the fastest growing financial brand in the world. Built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic money app with over 36 million active monthly users.
Loved by customers and by pop culture, we’ve held the #1 spot in finance on the App Store for almost two years, and our social media posts see more engagement in a day than most financial brands see in a year.
With major offices in San Francisco, New York, St. Louis, Portland, Kitchener-Waterloo, Toronto and Melbourne, Cash App is bringing a better way to send, spend, and save to anyone who has ever sought an alternative to today’s banking system.

Job Description

We are continually refining and searching for new ways to leverage ML to stay ahead of ever more sophisticated fraud and scam patterns. In addition, we are continually evolving our platform to scale up in line with Cash App’s global expansion, and to provide the rapid payments platform that our customers expect and demand.
Banking
The Banking ML team focuses on all things ML related to the Cash Card and Banking at Cash. There is an element of risk and fraud prevention involved. From building pipelines and models to combat fraud on every Cash Card transaction and activation, to building out data models and pipelines to enable a large expansion of Cash Check Deposits. We are a new team that was created to support the fast growing banking space within Cash App. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that our customers experience safe and reliable Banking with Cash App.
Customer Support
The Cash Customer Support ML team has a vision to provide customer support that’s better than humans through ML.

Applied Data Scientist,Spring Discovery,"San Carlos, CA 94070",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=8f8a9a4afb183701&fccid=10ff6404a90f469b&vjs=3,"Spring is accelerating the discovery of therapies for aging and its related diseases. Machine learning and data science are at our core, and we're building a rare computational team that works closely with our biologists, together fighting disease.

Impact
Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Yes, you belong
We are building a cross-functional team. We don't expect you to have a background in biology, just as we don't expect our biologists to be experts in ML. We do expect our teams to work respectfully and closely, learning together every day.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.

About you

Experience. You have 3+ years of real-world experience in data science, software development, or machine learning.
Maturity in face of ambiguity. You help define questions instead of just answering them. You work to resolve ambiguity — and you're comfortable making decisions when it remains.
Analytical intuition. You're comfortable dealing with data and forming and testing hypotheses. You have a developed sense of whether analysis lacks rigor and how to improve it.
Love answering questions that help others. You get energy being faced with a series of questions that are important for others’ work and driving quickly towards answers that help them.
Tends towards ownership. You’re able to lead an analysis from the earliest stages of acquiring data all the way through to reaching conclusions from that data.
Crisp communicator. You excel at crisp, concise written or spoken communication. You love learning and teaching others in a cross-functional team (we're biologists, computational folks, and more).
Driven by impact. You're most motivated when working on a problem of important consequence, no matter what's necessary to do so.


Nice to have

Biological data experience. You bring familiarity with the pitfalls and analytical techniques typically encountered with large biological datasets.
Deep learning intuition. You bring intuition about datasets and experiment structures for deep learning from personal experience.
Scientific background. You have cultural familiarity with scientists and labs from personal experience. You know the language of scientists as well as that of the technical world.

Benefits
Competitive salary and equity in a growing, well-funded startup
Excellent medical, dental, and vision coverage
Generous vacation policy
Healthy feedback-focused environment — leadership will have high expectations, regularly share constructive feedback, expect you to grow, and welcome receiving feedback from you


A unique moment
We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

And at the same time, we're just getting started. You're joining a team that has the funding needed to be ambitious while still early enough to help define our culture, choices, and success. Our expectations of you — and of ourselves — are high.

To fighting disease, together!"

Applied Data Scientist,Spring Discovery,"San Carlos, CA 94070",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=8f8a9a4afb183701&fccid=10ff6404a90f469b&vjs=3,"Spring is accelerating the discovery of therapies for aging and its related diseases. Machine learning and data science are at our core, and we're building a rare computational team that works closely with our biologists, together fighting disease.

Impact
Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Yes, you belong
We are building a cross-functional team. We don't expect you to have a background in biology, just as we don't expect our biologists to be experts in ML. We do expect our teams to work respectfully and closely, learning together every day.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.

About you

Experience. You have 3+ years of real-world experience in data science, software development, or machine learning.
Maturity in face of ambiguity. You help define questions instead of just answering them. You work to resolve ambiguity — and you're comfortable making decisions when it remains.
Analytical intuition. You're comfortable dealing with data and forming and testing hypotheses. You have a developed sense of whether analysis lacks rigor and how to improve it.
Love answering questions that help others. You get energy being faced with a series of questions that are important for others’ work and driving quickly towards answers that help them.
Tends towards ownership. You’re able to lead an analysis from the earliest stages of acquiring data all the way through to reaching conclusions from that data.
Crisp communicator. You excel at crisp, concise written or spoken communication. You love learning and teaching others in a cross-functional team (we're biologists, computational folks, and more).
Driven by impact. You're most motivated when working on a problem of important consequence, no matter what's necessary to do so.


Nice to have

Biological data experience. You bring familiarity with the pitfalls and analytical techniques typically encountered with large biological datasets.
Deep learning intuition. You bring intuition about datasets and experiment structures for deep learning from personal experience.
Scientific background. You have cultural familiarity with scientists and labs from personal experience. You know the language of scientists as well as that of the technical world.

Benefits
Competitive salary and equity in a growing, well-funded startup
Excellent medical, dental, and vision coverage
Generous vacation policy
Healthy feedback-focused environment — leadership will have high expectations, regularly share constructive feedback, expect you to grow, and welcome receiving feedback from you


A unique moment
We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

And at the same time, we're just getting started. You're joining a team that has the funding needed to be ambitious while still early enough to help define our culture, choices, and success. Our expectations of you — and of ourselves — are high.

To fighting disease, together!"

Senior Data Scientist,Span.IO,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=771e98e4afeeb6ff&fccid=764e5e1f9b11dc9a&vjs=3,"The Mission

The electrical grid was built to carry electricity unidirectionally from central fossil fuel plants to end consumers. As we transition to a renewable future built from rooftop solar and community storage, the grid itself needs an overhaul. Span's goal is to re-invent the grid from a clean slate to enable that transition, envisioning a grid made of distributed control systems and software as much as copper wires.

To accomplish this, we are upgrading the breaker panel — the humble box sitting at the center of every building's electrical wiring — to monitor, control, and make decisions about energy. This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.

Span's unique commitment to clean-slate ""right architecture"" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.

The Role

We aim to establish the Span panel as the center of home energy and the backbone of the renewable distributed grid. Analytics and ML are essential tools to develop features for the smart, green, energy-efficient home of the future. Span's unique ability to monitor and control individual circuits opens up a new avenue for proactive whole-home management and equipment failure detection. As Senior Data Scientist, you will leverage your deep understanding of ML, modeling, and statistics to solve problems including anomaly detection, time series forecasting, and event prediction with the goal to optimally manage whole-home energy consumption, deliver meaningful insights to the customer, and notify them about a potential failure of equipment or hazards in their home. You'll be involved through the entire development process, from the acquisition of all additional third-party data, the initial design to remote monitoring in the field.

Responsibilities

Lead the development of ML algorithms from the ground up which includes:

Gain knowledge in the relevant domain (e.g.common failure modes of appliances)

Feature engineering

Prototype new algorithms

Benchmark performance across large scale datasets

Use your experience with different machine learning frameworks to identify suitable tools for integration in Span's software platform

Integrate developed algorithms in our production code base with robust test coverage

Work with the firmware and software teams to design Span's edge model deployment framework; pick which ML framework Span should adopt

Proactively identify opportunities within Span that can benefit from data science analysis

Use fleet data to monitor algorithms in the field

Note: We're a startup, so while this list is broad, it's still just a start; you'll end up wearing many hats during your time at Span.

About You
Required Qualifications

Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, or a closely related field

4+ years' of professional experience with developing and implementing machine learning models to production

4+ years of Data Scientist experience

Deep understanding machine learning algorithms (anomaly/outlier detection in time series data, time series forecasting, clustering algorithms, probabilistic models)

Advanced Python skills, as well as familiarity with pandas and scikit-learn

Software design experience and ability to write clean, maintainable, and shippable production code

Experience working with SQL and data visualization tools

Extensive data modeling and data architecture skills

Knowledge and experience working within cloud computing environments such as AWS

Strong communication and interpersonal skills

Ability to understand and explain complex problems simply and effectively

Bonus Qualifications

Experience optimizing models for resource-constrained edge devices

Experience in data engineering

Domain-specific knowledge either through previous work, courses in college, or side projects

Life at Span

Span is a startup based in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco. We are a small, diverse team of creative thinkers. We value open communication, teamwork, and a make-it-happen attitude - no job is too big or too small. We strive to make change by imagining what the future could be and building a product to complete that vision. We are looking to grow our team with talented people who are on the same mission to shape the future of energy.

Working at Span, you can expect:

Competitive compensation at a well-funded, venture-backed company

Comprehensive benefits including a choice of medical plans; dental, vision, life and disability insurance

A sunny, airy office located close to BART and Caltrain public transit

Regular team lunches, brown bag learning opportunities, board games nights, and other opportunities to connect with teammates - in-person and now virtually

Equity grants at a quickly-growing startup

Flexible hours and vacation time - we simultaneously work hard and make space for the important stuff

To be a part of a team and culture that is hard-working, has a good sense of humor, values collaboration, and is just a little bit nerdy

Span embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be."

Machine Learning Engineer,Synapse Financial Technologies Inc,"San Francisco, CA 94105 (Financial District/South Beach area)+1 location",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=dcb40f05565741ee&fccid=e3d1e9ce06e668e2&vjs=3,"We are looking for machine learning engineers to help us build an automated backoffice. In traditional banks, back offices are filled with humans. Their job usually is to verify physical documents (like government issued IDs, proof of address, proof of income documents etc), fill out forms, and search for people on google (no joke) and other sites.
Instead of using people, we want to use machines to do these things. Here is our reasoning behind this: If we can automate the back office, then we won't have costs associated with customers like traditional banks. We would be able to offer state of the art finance products to everyone at a low cost, regardless of their bank balance. (Usually banks charge monthly management fees to people with lower bank balance, aka people with lower socioeconomic status - we want to break that cycle).
Check this out: https://medium.com/synapsefi/insto-instant-account-opening-a2aac88bc0dd. Everything here uses machine learning, from instant government ID verification, to video authentication to social media verification. These are the kind of tools you will be building.
In order to be successful at Synapse, you should have:
An ability to work independently within a small, fast-paced team
An entrepreneurial spirit and unrelenting passion to deliver the best service possible
The ability to implement feedback, learn quickly, and contribute new ideas
A general concern for the wellbeing of others and the desire to work on problems that maximize a positive future for humanity
Key Qualifications:
Experience with Python, with strong love for writing tests
Experience with Tensorflow, PyTorch, Numpy
Experience with working on computer vision or NLP problems
Ability to write clean, reliable code that can be easily maintained
Ability to solve problems and identify areas of improvement
Along with Python, we use flask to build APIs, docker to containerize them, rancher to deploy and orchestrate, AWS to host, CircleCI to test (and obviously Github in between all this). So experience with this stack is a plus, but not a necessity. These things are easy to learn.
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Statistics, Mathematics and/or a related field.
Perks:
Growth Potential
Competitive Salary
Insurance (Health//Dental//Vision)
One Medical membership
401(k) with company matching
Monthly commuter allowance, for travel to and from work
Healthy on-site breakfast and lunch crafted by Synapse’s own chefs

The first Data Scientist at Finrise will play an imperative role in enabling patient financing for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. You recognize that 56% of Americans with a less than ideal FICO Score need new ways to evaluate creditworthiness in efficient and holistic ways.

Data science, predictive models, and statistics are second nature. You excel in building machine learning systems, conducting foolproof analyses, and leading cross functional projects. While banks are busy evaluating 30-year-old FICO scores, created before a time of the internet and smartphones, you’re building models which will decide who to lend to in real-time. Instead of hiring hundreds of people to manually review, you’re adding new data points to ensure accurate scoring. You’re hands-on, creative, and hyper-analytical. You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.

What you'll be doing
Designing and developing core machine learning infrastructure
Conducting statistical analyses to assess the value of new data points and vendors
Building and deploying production risk models to improve Finrise patient underwriting
Hiring and leading a team of best-in-class data scientists
What you should already have

Spring is accelerating the discovery of therapies for aging and its related diseases. A tight integration of biology and machine learning is at our core, and we're building a rare team of scientists and computational folks working together to accelerate our innovative approach to modeling the biology of aging (in vitro and in vivo) and turning experimental data into therapeutic insight.

Impact

Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Key Responsibilities

Office management- Work directly with the Chief of Staff and Operations Manager to provide support and manage the organization and functionality of the office space

Travel Logistics- support flights, hotels, transportation, dining, etc. planning for both our remote employees as well as job candidates

Our team

We are building an interdisciplinary team. We don't expect you to have a background in machine learning, just as we don't expect our computer scientists to be expert biologists. We do expect our teams to work closely and learn together day in and day out.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.


A unique opportunity

We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, Susa, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

And at the same time, we're just getting started. You're joining a team that has the funding needed to be ambitious while still early enough to help define our culture, choices, and success. Our expectations of you — and of ourselves — are high.

About You

1+ years of preferably office management or EA experience in either tech or biotech
Ability to adapt quickly to last-minute needs in a diverse, fast-growing startup and execute tasks in a timely and out of the box manner
Excellent organizational, problem-solving, and follow-up skills, as well as the ability to effectively handle multiple priorities while working independently

Senior Data Scientist,Span.IO,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=771e98e4afeeb6ff&fccid=764e5e1f9b11dc9a&vjs=3,"The Mission

The electrical grid was built to carry electricity unidirectionally from central fossil fuel plants to end consumers. As we transition to a renewable future built from rooftop solar and community storage, the grid itself needs an overhaul. Span's goal is to re-invent the grid from a clean slate to enable that transition, envisioning a grid made of distributed control systems and software as much as copper wires.

To accomplish this, we are upgrading the breaker panel — the humble box sitting at the center of every building's electrical wiring — to monitor, control, and make decisions about energy. This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.

Span's unique commitment to clean-slate ""right architecture"" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.

The Role

We aim to establish the Span panel as the center of home energy and the backbone of the renewable distributed grid. Analytics and ML are essential tools to develop features for the smart, green, energy-efficient home of the future. Span's unique ability to monitor and control individual circuits opens up a new avenue for proactive whole-home management and equipment failure detection. As Senior Data Scientist, you will leverage your deep understanding of ML, modeling, and statistics to solve problems including anomaly detection, time series forecasting, and event prediction with the goal to optimally manage whole-home energy consumption, deliver meaningful insights to the customer, and notify them about a potential failure of equipment or hazards in their home. You'll be involved through the entire development process, from the acquisition of all additional third-party data, the initial design to remote monitoring in the field.

Responsibilities

Lead the development of ML algorithms from the ground up which includes:

Gain knowledge in the relevant domain (e.g.common failure modes of appliances)

Feature engineering

Prototype new algorithms

Benchmark performance across large scale datasets

Use your experience with different machine learning frameworks to identify suitable tools for integration in Span's software platform

Integrate developed algorithms in our production code base with robust test coverage

Work with the firmware and software teams to design Span's edge model deployment framework; pick which ML framework Span should adopt

Proactively identify opportunities within Span that can benefit from data science analysis

Use fleet data to monitor algorithms in the field

Note: We're a startup, so while this list is broad, it's still just a start; you'll end up wearing many hats during your time at Span.

About You
Required Qualifications

Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, or a closely related field

4+ years' of professional experience with developing and implementing machine learning models to production

4+ years of Data Scientist experience

Deep understanding machine learning algorithms (anomaly/outlier detection in time series data, time series forecasting, clustering algorithms, probabilistic models)

Advanced Python skills, as well as familiarity with pandas and scikit-learn

Software design experience and ability to write clean, maintainable, and shippable production code

Experience working with SQL and data visualization tools

Extensive data modeling and data architecture skills

Knowledge and experience working within cloud computing environments such as AWS

Strong communication and interpersonal skills

Ability to understand and explain complex problems simply and effectively

Bonus Qualifications

Experience optimizing models for resource-constrained edge devices

Experience in data engineering

Domain-specific knowledge either through previous work, courses in college, or side projects

Life at Span

Span is a startup based in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco. We are a small, diverse team of creative thinkers. We value open communication, teamwork, and a make-it-happen attitude - no job is too big or too small. We strive to make change by imagining what the future could be and building a product to complete that vision. We are looking to grow our team with talented people who are on the same mission to shape the future of energy.

Working at Span, you can expect:

Competitive compensation at a well-funded, venture-backed company

Comprehensive benefits including a choice of medical plans; dental, vision, life and disability insurance

A sunny, airy office located close to BART and Caltrain public transit

Regular team lunches, brown bag learning opportunities, board games nights, and other opportunities to connect with teammates - in-person and now virtually

Equity grants at a quickly-growing startup

Flexible hours and vacation time - we simultaneously work hard and make space for the important stuff

To be a part of a team and culture that is hard-working, has a good sense of humor, values collaboration, and is just a little bit nerdy

Span embraces diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. The more inclusive we are, the better our work will be."

NLP Engineer,Woebot Health,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=f203dfdd85cac048&fccid=6a5314410fd34d37&vjs=3,"Our mission is to make the best mental health tools radically accessible to everyone.

We're a venture-backed startup building tools to help millions of people monitor, regulate and ultimately improve their moods. Our tools are powered by the latest research in NLP and ML, use scientifically proven techniques from Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and are based on 10 years of digital mental health research at Stanford University. Our Chairman is Andrew Ng and Dan Jurafsky is a member of our advisory board, both globally recognized leaders in AI/NLP.

We are poised to redefine how people access mental health care and are building the dream team that's excited about getting us there. You will be working with modern ML tech such as PyTorch, AWS SageMaker, and Prodigy, as well as Python toolkits like NumPy, pandas, and Hugging Face Transformers.

How You'll Thrive

Ramping Up

Within your first 30 days: You'll learn about the Woebot content architecture and how ML and NLP are used to guide conversations with our users. You will learn the major components of our NLP model production pipeline as well as the ways we label their data and train them.
Equally important, you will build relationships with other engineers, as well as content, product, and clinical teams.

Solve Problems That Matter

By day 60 you will begin to develop an understanding of the product, processes, and codebase, including user input matching, transcript reviews, annotation instructions, and data architecture.
You've delivered at least one large project or several smaller projects with high quality and minimal bugs. Examples below:
You might oversee the annotation of a new dataset, writing instructions for annotators, monitoring progress, and ensuring consistency.
You might design and implement user input matching at a new conversation flow or analyze input to identify areas for improvement.
You're developing features that help change our users' lives. To achieve this, you're:
Writing clean code that you have manually tested,
Creating documentation to help the content and product teams understand how our NLP works.
Giving and receiving feedback with other engineers and having a humble growth mindset.

Become a Key Member of the AI Team

By day 90 you will be able to work with other engineers on feature feasibility and help estimate story points for more complex features.
We work in small teams and value everyone's opinion. You'll work directly with product managers, user interaction designers, and graphic designers to provide technical feedback that will help us create the best product for our users.
You'll also write clear story descriptions, craft detailed Github pull requests, and leave code better than you found it.

Growth Opportunity

Beyond Day 90 you will become a thought leader for our NLU, working diligently to improve our understanding of users and to inform product features.
You will find creative ways to work around data limitations such as automated data augmentation and labeling.
You will use your knowledge of linguistics and engineering to help maintain a test suite that ensures a consistent perceived IQ and EQ for Weobot.
Long term, you'll improve your ability to interface with other teams, write technical design documents, and lead projects from conception to completion.
You will work on regulated medical products that must adhere to the highest quality standards. As a result, you will become a master of your craft, delivering and rigorously testing and measuring NLU features to fully understand capabilities and limitations.

This Might Be Your Next Career Move IF:

You care about helping make quality mental health care realistically accessible to millions of people nationwide
You have experience applying linguistics within a real world product.
You enjoy tracking down and eliminating false positives and false negatives.

Role-specific competencies

At least 2+ years of relevant experience in Natural Language Understanding, Intent Classification and Slot Filling, Dialogue Management, Question Answering, Text Classification, Information Retrieval, or Knowledge Extraction.
You have experience with data annotation projects in a production setting including writing annotation instructions, monitoring annotators, and ensuring consistency and inter-rater reliability. Familiarity with Prodigy is a plus.
You have a rich understanding of linguistic nuances such as semantics and pragmatics, and appreciate the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art NLP models as they pertain to these.
You have professional experience writing Python code or very high-quality independent projects to demonstrate aptitude. Familiarity with regular expressions is a plus.
You understand machine learning basics or are passionate about learning.

Our Core Values

Empathic: You're a compassionate person and a team player motivated to understand others and help them be successful, too. You care as deeply for your colleagues as you do for our mission and our users.
Self-aware: You possess a high level of emotional intelligence, which allows you to understand yourself and others, and to have a healthy emotional life in the workplace.
Proactive & flexible:You are able to hit the ground running, you take responsibility for finding a way to get the job done. You learn as quickly as possible and sometimes do things outside the immediate scope of your work, giving it all you've got.
Strong work-ethic: You've mastered healthy habits in your life that allow you to do great things. You exemplify dedication and commitment to coming up with very good results in your work and inspire others to do the same.
Growth mindset: You believe abilities – like intelligence and talent – can be developed through dedication and hard work. You see failure as an opportunity to grow and welcome feedback as a pathway to your continued success.
Humble: You recognize that you are one among many, and you hold a genuine desire to discover what other people can offer. You are intrigued by how others think, and how others feel differently from you. You lean into these moments with patience and curiosity.

Use it to directly and ethically impact the experience of thousands of patients every day and around the world! We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer with creative ideas in artificial intelligence, visual analysis, data storage, security and the production experience to prove it.
What You'll Do
You will work on a variety of innovative and meaningful projects, from developing vision machine learning algorithms for applications such as patient monitoring, to building a training infrastructure for the core machine learning platform. Your solutions will make a significant impact in patients' healing experience and how the caretakers monitor patient well-being.
Who You Are
You’re creative. You’re organized. You’re experienced. You’ve done this before. You want to do it again. We’re not looking for a superhero who thinks sheer hours = good work. Excess doesn’t impress us – creativity and efficiency do. You’ll have 8 hours a day to work, and, we hope, at least 8 hours a night to sleep.
You are a passionate software engineer with a deep understanding of what makes live, highly scalable platforms. You care deeply about bringing your unique engineering mind into creating a considerate and sustainable team and product.
You are autonomous - a manager of one. You enjoy working alone, you can make your own decisions and you will take full ownership of your work, assuming the responsibility for every detail, every step of the way.
You are a solid writer. You document your every decision so you don't just save the day, but make the lives of your future teammates easier.
Qualifications

Experience with PyTorch, or at least another major deep learning framework such as TensorFlow, MXNet.
Preferred Qualifications
MS or PhD degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or related technical field.
Benefits
We work remotely and asynchronously, and that is why we are looking for a manager of one. But you will need to overlap for a few hours with San Francisco time in your normal work-day routine - this may mean a few hours of meetings in the evening depending on your time zone - we do our best to keep them short. We can provide you with space outside of your home to work if you need to (e.g. co-working offices), or help get your home to be more accommodating to work.
We do not trap people in front of their screens or lock them in overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours and ample vacation time. See our employee handbook here.
How To Apply
We want to get a sense of how you think and work. To that end, please be prepared to share with us your take on the following:
Tell us what you know about machine learning. How would you begin to approach figuring out where we stand with our technology, and where we should be standing?
Chart us an example of a machine learning pipeline that can support the needs of modern applications (related to detecting a person's activity)
What technologies inspired you recently? What machine learning technologies are you the most excited about?
We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Ouva is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.

Sr. ML Solutions Architect, AWS Startups

Do you like startups? Are you interested in cloud computing? Are you passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning? Yes? We have a role you might find interesting.

Startups are the large enterprises of the future. These young companies are founded by ambitious people who have a desire to build something meaningful and challenge the status quo. They seek to address underserved customers, or to challenge incumbents. They usually operate in an environment of scarcity: whether that’s capital, engineering resource, or experience. This is where you come in.

We are looking for technical builders with a background in AI and ML who love the idea of working with startups that differentiate their product via the application of Machine Learning. In this role, you’ll work directly with these customers, helping them make the build and deploy their products, services, and models in the cloud successfully. You’ll have a chance to build enduring relationships with these companies and establish yourself as a trusted advisor.

As well as spending time working directly with customers, you’ll also get plenty of time to “sharpen the saw” and keep your skills fresh. We have more than 175 services across a range of different categories and it’s important that we can help startups take advantages of the right ones. You’ll also play an important role as an advocate with our product teams to make sure we are building the right products and features for the startups you work with. And for the customers you don’t get to work with on a 1:1 basis you’ll share knowledge more broadly by working on technical content and presenting at events.

About the hiring group

The AWS Startup Solutions Architecture team is dedicated to working with these early stage startup companies as they build their businesses. We’re here to make sure that they can deploy the best, most scalable, and most secure architectures possible – and that they spend as little time and money as possible doing so.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have twelve employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded professional and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

As this role supports customers that are building their products and services that leverage the Machine Learning as a product or service differentiator, additional experience in the following Machine Learning areas are highly desired:

Experience in ML models and distributed training
Expertise in Data Architecture.
Experience in Machine Learning optimized infrastructure, such as GPUs.
Intermediate or advanced experience architecting/operating ML stacks built on AWS is preferred.
Senior leadership role at a startup.
Working knowledge of software development tools and methodologies
Demonstrated ability to adapt to new technologies and learn quickly.
AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate, Professional, Machine Learning, or Analytics specialty.
Experience developing and deploying modern application architectures, including serverless and containerized solutions.

In this role, you'll get to:
Establish measurement methodologies to understand the value of email as a channel that contributes to acquisition, onboarding, cross sell and retention. Build business cases for investing additional resources into the email program.
Use experimentation methodologies, control groups etc. to measure the impact of email campaigns and suggest improvements to marketers.
Collaborate with our audience targeting and segmentation team to ensure customers are receiving consistent and meaningful messages.

Experience with Git
Experience with providing analytics support for multi-channel campaigns
Deep knowledge of statistics and probability
An advanced degree in a quantitative discipline, such as statistics, economics, mathematics, or computer science
More about our team
Atlassian is over a decade old, but our team is much younger. We'll have to blaze new trails to enable important growth decisions, so we're constantly growing, learning, and trying to doing things differently. We're self-proclaimed unicorns that are able to distill highly complex analytical terminology and concepts into easily consumable language, and we interface directly with marketing teams to transmit that knowledge effectively. We've been described as scrappy, but thorough, because we're dedicated to an agile methodology that enables moving fast while still ensuring quality deliverables. We also know all too well the importance of validating assumptions in our data, and we use various types of testing to prove those assumptions. It's all about enabling Atlassian to grow by delivering data in the right way to partners across the company.
More about our benefits
Whether you work in an office or a distributed team, Atlassian is highly collaborative and yes, fun! To support you at work (and play) we offer some fantastic perks: ample time off to relax and recharge, flexible working options, five paid volunteer days a year for your favourite cause, an annual allowance to support your learning & growth, unique ShipIt days, a company paid trip after five years and lots more.

We're a venture-backed startup building tools to help millions of people monitor, regulate and ultimately improve their moods. Our tools are powered by the latest research in NLP and ML, use scientifically proven techniques from Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and are based on 10 years of digital mental health research at Stanford University. Our Chairman is Andrew Ng and Dan Jurafsky is a member of our advisory board, both globally recognized leaders in AI/NLP.

We are poised to redefine how people access mental health care and are building the dream team that's excited about getting us there. You will be working with modern ML tech such as PyTorch, AWS SageMaker, and Prodigy, as well as Python toolkits like NumPy, pandas, and Hugging Face Transformers.

How You'll Thrive

Ramping Up

Within your first 30 days: You'll learn about the Woebot content architecture and how ML and NLP are used to guide conversations with our users. You will learn the major components of our NLP model production pipeline as well as the ways we label their data and train them.
Equally important, you will build relationships with other engineers, as well as content, product, and clinical teams.

Solve Problems That Matter

By day 60 you will begin to develop an understanding of the product, processes, and codebase, including user input matching, transcript reviews, annotation instructions, and data architecture.
You've delivered at least one large project or several smaller projects with high quality and minimal bugs. Examples below:
You might oversee the annotation of a new dataset, writing instructions for annotators, monitoring progress, and ensuring consistency.
You might design and implement user input matching at a new conversation flow or analyze input to identify areas for improvement.
You're developing features that help change our users' lives. To achieve this, you're:
Writing clean code that you have manually tested,
Creating documentation to help the content and product teams understand how our NLP works.
Giving and receiving feedback with other engineers and having a humble growth mindset.

Become a Key Member of the AI Team

By day 90 you will be able to work with other engineers on feature feasibility and help estimate story points for more complex features.
We work in small teams and value everyone's opinion. You'll work directly with product managers, user interaction designers, and graphic designers to provide technical feedback that will help us create the best product for our users.
You'll also write clear story descriptions, craft detailed Github pull requests, and leave code better than you found it.

Growth Opportunity

Beyond Day 90 you will become a thought leader for our NLU, working diligently to improve our understanding of users and to inform product features.
You will find creative ways to work around data limitations such as automated data augmentation and labeling.
You will use your knowledge of linguistics and engineering to help maintain a test suite that ensures a consistent perceived IQ and EQ for Weobot.
Long term, you'll improve your ability to interface with other teams, write technical design documents, and lead projects from conception to completion.
You will work on regulated medical products that must adhere to the highest quality standards. As a result, you will become a master of your craft, delivering and rigorously testing and measuring NLU features to fully understand capabilities and limitations.

This Might Be Your Next Career Move IF:

You care about helping make quality mental health care realistically accessible to millions of people nationwide
You have experience applying linguistics within a real world product.
You enjoy tracking down and eliminating false positives and false negatives.

Role-specific competencies

At least 2+ years of relevant experience in Natural Language Understanding, Intent Classification and Slot Filling, Dialogue Management, Question Answering, Text Classification, Information Retrieval, or Knowledge Extraction.

You have professional experience writing Python code or very high-quality independent projects to demonstrate aptitude. Familiarity with regular expressions is a plus.
You understand machine learning basics or are passionate about learning.

Our Core Values

Self-aware: You possess a high level of emotional intelligence, which allows you to understand yourself and others, and to have a healthy emotional life in the workplace.
Proactive & flexible:You are able to hit the ground running, you take responsibility for finding a way to get the job done. You learn as quickly as possible and sometimes do things outside the immediate scope of your work, giving it all you've got.
Strong work-ethic: You've mastered healthy habits in your life that allow you to do great things. You exemplify dedication and commitment to coming up with very good results in your work and inspire others to do the same.
Growth mindset: You believe abilities – like intelligence and talent – can be developed through dedication and hard work. You see failure as an opportunity to grow and welcome feedback as a pathway to your continued success.
Humble: You recognize that you are one among many, and you hold a genuine desire to discover what other people can offer. You are intrigued by how others think, and how others feel differently from you. You lean into these moments with patience and curiosity.

Looking for a technical SEO job that is more challenging, and also more rewarding? Glassdoor's mission is to help people everywhere find a job and company they love. We're transforming an entire industry through the power of transparency. As the world's leading career community, our vision is for a world where transparency holds companies accountable to strive to become better employers. And the main way we expand our community is through SEO at tremendous scale. That's where you come in.

SEO and earned media have been essential to Glassdoor's growth from the beginning, when we launched a salaries and reviews site to bring transparency to a few hundred employers. Now our SEO operation sprawls across millions of employers, 23 international domains, seven languages, and hundreds of millions of URLs. Our SEO implementation is technically sophisticated, and our integrations with search engines are unique and complex. We have a team of SEO specialists who partner with our product and marketing teams, an SEO product manager, and a dedicated SEO engineering team. We need a technical SEO expert to analyze huge data sets to inform our strategy, and advise our engineering team on implementation.

Compensation: $91,000 - $114,000
At Glassdoor, operating transparently is at the heart of everything we do. That's why we let job seekers know that salary ranges may differ for jobs depending on where these positions are filled. It's no secret that the cost of living and other economic considerations vary widely across the country and the world.

At Glassdoor we apply a ""tier"" system to promote consistency in level of compensation for where roles are filled in different locations. The tiers are as follows:

Tier 1 encompasses the highest salary range for states where large metropolitan areas are located (ie: San Francisco, New York City, Washington DC, & etc)
Tier 2 encompasses salary ranges 15% less than those in Tier 1 for states with mid-sized cities (ie: Chicago, Dallas, Portland, etc)
Tier 3 encompasses salary ranges 20% less than those in Tier 1 for states with smaller
cities (including our Ohio office, Nevada, etc)

Regularly crawl and analyze our site, and conduct log file analysis to identify problems and test new features.
Help define our approach to canonicalization, hreflang, junk URL elimination and overall crawl architecture.
Regularly monitor traffic, crawling, and indexation to identify problems early, so we can fix them.

Build reports and dashboards to enable our product managers and SEO team to make informed decisions about SEO.

Strong work-ethic: You've mastered healthy habits in your life that allow you to do great things. You exemplify dedication and commitment to coming up with very good results in your work and inspire others to do the same.
Growth mindset: You believe abilities – like intelligence and talent – can be developed through dedication and hard work. You see failure as an opportunity to grow and welcome feedback as a pathway to your continued success.
Humble: You recognize that you are one among many, and you hold a genuine desire to discover what other people can offer. You are intrigued by how others think, and how others feel differently from you. You lean into these moments with patience and curiosity.

We're transforming the workplace experience through the power of transparency. As the worldwide leader in employer branding and insights, our vision is for a world where transparency empowers the workforce and motivates companies to become better employers.

Please note this role is open to remote hiring. Our main office locations are in San Francisco, CA, Chicago, IL, Uniontown, OH and London, Eng.

About the Role

Looking for a technical SEO job that is more challenging, and also more rewarding? Glassdoor's mission is to help people everywhere find a job and company they love. We're transforming an entire industry through the power of transparency. As the world's leading career community, our vision is for a world where transparency holds companies accountable to strive to become better employers. And the main way we expand our community is through SEO at tremendous scale. That's where you come in.

SEO and earned media have been essential to Glassdoor's growth from the beginning, when we launched a salaries and reviews site to bring transparency to a few hundred employers. Now our SEO operation sprawls across millions of employers, 23 international domains, seven languages, and hundreds of millions of URLs. Our SEO implementation is technically sophisticated, and our integrations with search engines are unique and complex. We have a team of SEO specialists who partner with our product and marketing teams, an SEO product manager, and a dedicated SEO engineering team. We need a technical SEO expert to analyze huge data sets to inform our strategy, and advise our engineering team on implementation.

Compensation: $91,000 - $114,000
At Glassdoor, operating transparently is at the heart of everything we do. That's why we let job seekers know that salary ranges may differ for jobs depending on where these positions are filled. It's no secret that the cost of living and other economic considerations vary widely across the country and the world.

At Glassdoor we apply a ""tier"" system to promote consistency in level of compensation for where roles are filled in different locations. The tiers are as follows:

Tier 1 encompasses the highest salary range for states where large metropolitan areas are located (ie: San Francisco, New York City, Washington DC, & etc)
Tier 2 encompasses salary ranges 15% less than those in Tier 1 for states with mid-sized cities (ie: Chicago, Dallas, Portland, etc)
Tier 3 encompasses salary ranges 20% less than those in Tier 1 for states with smaller
cities (including our Ohio office, Nevada, etc)

You can learn more about our compensation philosophy here and see salary ranges for all Glassdoor jobs here.

What You'll Do:

Advise our SEO engineering team on technical implementation issues, such as client-side vs server side rendering, structured data markup in LD+JSON, error handling, and crawl management.
Collaborate with a variety of stakeholders (including Business Operations, Data Science and Engineering teams) in driving solutions to overcome large-scale technical challenges.
Regularly crawl and analyze our site, and conduct log file analysis to identify problems and test new features.
Help define our approach to canonicalization, hreflang, junk URL elimination and overall crawl architecture.
Regularly monitor traffic, crawling, and indexation to identify problems early, so we can fix them.
Lead our integration with Google for Jobs, Google's separate vertical search experience for jobs. We continuously share with them an inventory of several million open jobs via an API integration. It's halfway between traditional SEO and a job syndication partnership, and you will become one of the world's leading experts in this niche channel.
Build reports and dashboards to enable our product managers and SEO team to make informed decisions about SEO.
Analyze experiments conducted using our proprietary SEO A/B testing platform.

What You'll Bring

3-6 years experience in SEO or related fields (ideally working on large-scale enterprise sites).

We've had a lot of success here in SEO over the years, but we expect you to be full of great ideas, too. Be bold.
Our team sets ambitious goals and works hard to achieve them. The ideal candidate likes delivering on big goals and winning.

Senior Data Engineer,Convex Tech,"San Francisco, CA•Remote",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=b942b204533f2b46&fccid=e541f070f1702ce9&vjs=3,"At Convex, data is not an incidental byproduct of our app. The data team is not a support function or an experimental lab. Data is the star of our app, and the data team is at the heart of our business.

Our product, Atlas, provides rich data on virtually every commercial property in the country (and all of the workflow software built on top of that to make it useful). Think Redfin for every commercial property, with Salesforce functionality to organize and track your work. For our users who serve these properties, this data and workflow becomes their secret weapon; there's nothing else like it available in the market today.

Our market is under the radar, but massive and ubiquitous commercial services industry. Our customers are responsible for the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the lighting, safety, security, and dozens of other privileges that we are incredibly fortunate to take for granted in buildings across all of America.

Our customers live and work in almost every state in America. They include some of the largest enterprises in the country, like Siemens and Carrier, and smaller businesses we care just as deeply about.

The Data Opportunity
Because data is core to our product, your role is central to our entire business. Your data features in the product frequently close massive deals and drive best-in-class retention. Every customer experiences your improvements, in prod, immediately – this is not an internal BI role.

From an engineering perspective, every commercial property means massive data sets – and demanding performance and architecture requirements for your features to be put through. Geospatial data often requires GIS techniques to wrangle datasets – something different than the average SQL join. Data on virtually every commercial property in the US means a chance to see the country by way of satellite imagery, property boundaries, and several hundred other data elements we have already developed.

The Role
We are looking for an experienced Data Engineer / Data Architect to build scalable platforms that enable efficient data movement within Convex across various sources, sinks, and support continuous data integration and processing with external enterprise systems via secure APIs and connectors.
You will have a chance to:Design and implement reusable solutions and architectures for data sharing and processing use casesSupport and improve our multi-tenant data pipeline, processes, infrastructure, and stackDrive end-to-end performance, scaling, observability, and monitoring of our platformsCreate data governance models, including assets, relationships, domains, and communitiesWork in the heart of a business with multiple partner teams to build cross-functional customer solutions

About Convex
At Convex (YC W19), we’re building the leading B2B full-stack software platform for the $400bn+ commercial services market. It's a 100-year-old industry impacting millions of people every day. We already work with some of the largest enterprise companies in the sector and were one of the fastest growing companies in the Winter 2019 YC batch. Our team is a unique mix of industry veterans from Carrier, Siemens, and Honeywell as well as founders from MIT, Harvard, and Georgia Tech. Based in San Francisco, our investors include Emergence Capital, 1984 Ventures, UP2398, Liquid2 (Joe Montana), YCombinator, the founders of PlanGrid, and others.

In this role, you'll get to:
Establish measurement methodologies to understand the value of email as a channel that contributes to acquisition, onboarding, cross sell and retention. Build business cases for investing additional resources into the email program.
Use experimentation methodologies, control groups etc. to measure the impact of email campaigns and suggest improvements to marketers.
Collaborate with our audience targeting and segmentation team to ensure customers are receiving consistent and meaningful messages.
Work with our Marketing Engineering and Data Engineering teams to improve the tools and data sets we have for the email channel.

Deep knowledge of statistics and probability
An advanced degree in a quantitative discipline, such as statistics, economics, mathematics, or computer science
More about our team
Atlassian is over a decade old, but our team is much younger. We'll have to blaze new trails to enable important growth decisions, so we're constantly growing, learning, and trying to doing things differently. We're self-proclaimed unicorns that are able to distill highly complex analytical terminology and concepts into easily consumable language, and we interface directly with marketing teams to transmit that knowledge effectively. We've been described as scrappy, but thorough, because we're dedicated to an agile methodology that enables moving fast while still ensuring quality deliverables. We also know all too well the importance of validating assumptions in our data, and we use various types of testing to prove those assumptions. It's all about enabling Atlassian to grow by delivering data in the right way to partners across the company.
More about our benefits
Whether you work in an office or a distributed team, Atlassian is highly collaborative and yes, fun! To support you at work (and play) we offer some fantastic perks: ample time off to relax and recharge, flexible working options, five paid volunteer days a year for your favourite cause, an annual allowance to support your learning & growth, unique ShipIt days, a company paid trip after five years and lots more.

Use it to directly and ethically impact the experience of thousands of patients every day and around the world!

You will work on a variety of innovative and meaningful projects, from developing vision machine learning algorithms for applications such as patient monitoring, to building a training infrastructure for the core machine learning platform. Your solutions will make a significant impact in patients' healing experience and how the caretakers monitor patient well-being.
Who You Are
You’re creative. You’re organized. You’re experienced. You’ve done this before. You want to do it again. We’re not looking for a superhero who thinks sheer hours = good work. Excess doesn’t impress us – creativity and efficiency do. You’ll have 8 hours a day to work, and, we hope, at least 8 hours a night to sleep.
You are a passionate software engineer with a deep understanding of what makes live, highly scalable platforms. You care deeply about bringing your unique engineering mind into creating a considerate and sustainable team and product.
You are autonomous - a manager of one. You enjoy working alone, you can make your own decisions and you will take full ownership of your work, assuming the responsibility for every detail, every step of the way.
You are a solid writer. You document your every decision so you don't just save the day, but make the lives of your future teammates easier.
Qualifications

Experience with PyTorch, or at least another major deep learning framework such as TensorFlow, MXNet.
Preferred Qualifications
MS or PhD degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or related technical field.
Benefits
We work remotely and asynchronously, and that is why we are looking for a manager of one. But you will need to overlap for a few hours with San Francisco time in your normal work-day routine - this may mean a few hours of meetings in the evening depending on your time zone - we do our best to keep them short. We can provide you with space outside of your home to work if you need to (e.g. co-working offices), or help get your home to be more accommodating to work.
We do not trap people in front of their screens or lock them in overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours and ample vacation time. See our employee handbook here.
How To Apply
We want to get a sense of how you think and work. To that end, please be prepared to share with us your take on the following:
Tell us what you know about machine learning. How would you begin to approach figuring out where we stand with our technology, and where we should be standing?
Chart us an example of a machine learning pipeline that can support the needs of modern applications (related to detecting a person's activity)
What technologies inspired you recently? What machine learning technologies are you the most excited about?
We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Ouva is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.

Who is Allbirds?

At Allbirds, we believe in using business as a force for good. We're a global footwear and apparel brand with roots in New Zealand and our headquarters in San Francisco. Since 2016, we've been on a mission to prove that comfort, design, and sustainability aren't mutually exclusive. Our commitment to creating better things in a better way is fueled by a belief that the fashion industry needs to focus less on flash and more on thoughtfulness. And as a certified B Corp, we're dedicated to making the most sustainable products we can using premium natural materials - designed for life's everyday adventures.

However, much of this data is fragmented in various systems which requires manual effort to analyze and refresh. This role will help us manage this complexity by developing the data foundations for our HQ Supply Chain and Global Commercial teams to drive operational decisions.

This role will require collaborating closely with cross functional business owners, thorough data consolidation and analysis, drawing insight from analysis, and sharing tools with cross-functional stakeholders.

Support the broader Supply Chain teams (Production, Sourcing, Planning, Logistics, Fulfillment) by providing key data insights and strategic thinking to improve current processes, visibility, and drive improvement in sustainability, cost, quality, speed and service.
Build and support the Supply Chain analytics and technology roadmap, such as procuring global planning software and working with Engineering to prioritize improvement projects

What kind of person are we looking for?

Passionate about sustainability and making Better Things in a Better Way
2-5 years of experience in a highly analytical role
Entrepreneurial, self-directed and resourceful. You thrive in a highly dynamic and unstructured environment but understand the value of adding structure and process.
A bold thinker who is not afraid to try new approaches to problems and take risks
Never satisfied with the status quo. You're constantly looking to improve upon processes, analyses, and data products you create.
Perpetually curious, always seeking to improve your understanding of Allbirds' business and identify new improvement opportunities
Ability to work on numerous projects simultaneously with the ability to push ""quick wins"" to implementation.
Highly collaborative approach and able to work with cross-functional teams such as Engineering, Production, Sourcing, Finance, Planning, Logistics/Warehousing.
Ability to think strategically and execute tactically with a persistent attention to detail.
Baseline knowledge of retail and supply chain fundamentals a plus

More practical skills needed:

BA/BS or equivalent, preferably with quantitative focus
Advanced Excel and Google Sheets modeling skills are a must
Expertise with Looker or other BI tools a must
SQL, Power Query, and/or other big data programming experience a must
Python experience preferred
Google AppScript (or Javascript) experience highly preferred
Experience in Supply Chain role preferred

We’re on a mission to hire the very best and are committed to creating exceptional employee experiences where everyone is respected and has access to equal opportunity. We realize that new ideas can come from everywhere in the organization, and we know the next big idea could be yours!
The Opportunity
Machine Learning is a critical part of Adobe’s Cloud offering. Adobe Clouds enable customers to build and manage digital content, such as assets, composites, 3D, documents etc., and digital experience and transformations.
Creative Cloud is focused on visual imagination and creation, and includes such well-known products as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Adobe Stock. Document Cloud is centered around the creation and management of textual documents, including Acrobat and Adobe Sign. Experience Cloud is the set of offerings for the large-scale enterprise, covering marketing, advertising, and analytics.
Adobe Sensei powers machine learning and artificial intelligence across all of these Adobe Cloud product lines. This platform enables thousands of applied researchers, millions of users, and billions of content pieces. The objective is to make machine learning offerings a world-class, leading-edge, differentiating product in Adobe Cloud ecosystem. We match the pace, innovation and excitement of a startup, backed by the resources and infrastructure of Adobe!
Data is critical piece of developing machine learning solutions. ML data can include the datasets that train algorithms, but also large-scale evaluation datasets which give insights into algorithm behavior that helps to refine and evolve ML products.
Training data – Adobe’s training datasets often contain digital art, photos, videos, text, or audio files, along with some type of additional knowledge data (user behaviors, annotations, manipulations) to enable meaningful machine learning. How do we build these datasets to maximize performance and accuracy for the customer? How do we ensure that our models are robust and unbiased?
Evaluation - How do we assess the quality of our algorithms and models? What is the ground truth we use to judge them? Where do they succeed and how do they fail? These problems are even more subtle in the complex, creative domains of Adobe products – for example, how should we judge the quality of similarity search, where a user finds new images with an image as the query?
We’re looking for data scientists to define, drive, and coordinate training data construction and model evaluation for the Applied Machine Learning team at Adobe. This will involve thinking hard about product quality, the role of machine learning in those products, and the capabilities of large-scale human-judgment tasks to support scalable solutions that generate the fuel for success of our AI/ML algorithms.
Responsibilities:
Work closely with product, research, and engineering leaders to understand ML applications and define success.
Interact with APIs to effectively sample raw data to optimize for ML training and evaluation.
Design tasks and guidelines for human judgment jobs to annotate images, videos, text, audio; and also to measure the performance of machine-learned and other advanced algorithms.
Help design A/B tests for our cloud offerings, and use human judgment vs. end-user A/B tests as appropriate
Create a winning culture built on collaboration and shared accomplishments- have fun along the way!
Qualifications:
BS or MS in a technical field (Computer Science, Physics, Math, Statistics) OR in a human-centered field such as Psychology, Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction.
Exposure to applied machine learning in an enterprise setting.
Proven experience in validation and evaluation of machine learned models.
Strong quantitative and analytical orientation. Experience in evaluation metrics, Python or R, JSON parsing, custom HTML for visualization.
Strong qualitative skillset. Experience in taxonomies, survey design.
Understanding of issues around ground truth and training/evaluation data for ML, including human judgment and A/B testing
Hands-on experience using third-party judgment services such as Figure 8, Appen, or Amazon Mechanical Turk.
At Adobe, you will be immersed in an exceptional work environment that is recognized throughout the world on Best Companies lists. You will also be surrounded by colleagues who are committed to helping each other grow through our unique Check-In approach where ongoing feedback flows freely.

Retool’s user base is growing quickly, and we’ve found ourselves with more evidence to answer an increasing number of questions that drive our business and product. We’re looking to hire a Data Scientist to take the lead on analysis and metrics to inform our product and business.

We’re looking for someone who is passionate about analyzing data across all domains, motivated by having an impact on the business and is constantly curious. This is the right role for someone who thrives from making sense of the blurry space that is data at high growth startup.
WHAT YOU'LL DO

We’ll look to you to help us establish KPIs and ensure we have the tooling to measure and access said KPIs. You’ll apply statistical knowledge and the scientific method to the data questions we face today around product analytics and pricing, and help us think critically about the questions of tomorrow.
You’ll also take on ownership of our data stack to ensure that your teammates are able to access the data they need to make decisions and technical teams are able to quickly implement events. We’ve already built out a solid stack on top of Segment, BigQuery, DBT and, of course, Retool, but we need your help to ensure it scales with the company as our user base grows.
Retool is a small but fast growing startup with more questions than answers and we’re looking for someone who is excited to wear many hats and jump in wherever is needed. This means each day will be a little different and we’ll look to you to juggle a variety of projects and deadlines. We are looking for someone who has a talent for finding a way forward with evidence-driven impact.

3+ years of experience working on analytics, ideally at a high growth company or SaaS business.
Highly skilled at writing SQL. A strong enthusiasm for SQL, in all its flavors, is a plus.
Experience working with, or a healthy interest in and knowledge of, event driven infrastructure and ETL processes.
Comfortable with common git workflows and at least one scripting or statistical programming language(ideally Python and/or R).
A solution-oriented growth mindset.
A demonstrated knowledge of experiment design.
Experience partnering with cross-functional stakeholders.
Strong communication and presentation skills.
IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL:
Work with product and business (marketing, sales, success, support) teams to identify key questions and answer them with data.
Develop key metrics and ensure observability via dashboards and other relevant tooling.
Apply analytical skills to understand user behavior.
Regularly communicate learnings to the company.
Lead the collection and modeling of data in our warehouse — from new sources to integrating existing sources.
Work with engineering to implement tracking and debug missing data. Yes, you’ll be jumping into our Javascript code base.
Define tracking best practices.
Be a self starter.
Retool is a fast way of building internal tools through our low-code drag-and-drop platform. We were founded in 2017 and graduated from YC the same year. Our Series A and B were led by Sequoia and we're backed by Daniel Gross (whose company is right upstairs from us!), John and Patrick Collison of Stripe, and Elad Gil, among others."
