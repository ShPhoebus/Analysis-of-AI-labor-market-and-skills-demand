We believe global trade can move the human race forward. That's why it's our mission to make global trade easier for everyone. We aim to do this by building the Operating System for Global trade - a strategic model combining advanced technology and data analytics, logistics infrastructure, and supply chain expertise. Flexport today connects almost 10,000 clients and suppliers across 109 countries, including established global brands like Georgia-Pacific, as well as emerging innovators like Sonos. Started in 2013, we've raised over $1.3B in funding from SoftBank Vision Fund, Founders Fund, GV, First Round Capital, and Y Combinator. We're excited about the three big ways we're moving forward after our recent $1B investment from SoftBank Vision Fund in February 2019.

Are you worried about not having any freight forwarding experience?
Don't be! We're building the first Operating System for Global Trade. That's why it's crucial for us to bring people from diverse backgrounds and experiences together with our industry veterans to help move the freight forwarding industry forward.
What's freight forwarding, and why does it matter? Freight forwarding is the coordination and shipment of goods from one place to another, and it's what makes global trade possible. Flexport is on a mission to make global trade easier for everyone because we believe it can help connect the world and break down economic barriers.
We know this industry is complex. That's why we invest in education starting day one with Flexport Academy, a one-week intensive onboarding program explicitly designed to set every new Flexport employee up for success.

At Flexport, our ability to fulfill our mission of making global trade easy for everyone relies on having a diverse, dedicated, and engaged workforce.

We are seeking a talent who will share our obsession for data accuracy; someone with an insatiable appetite for learning new things and accomplishing challenging goals in a fast-paced (and not always structured) environment. We are looking for someone that is highly motivated and knows how to get things done quickly and efficiently.
We have a product that is changing how brands, agencies and networks measure and assess the impact of TV advertising campaigns. Our software uses proprietary audio and video analysis to monitor and extract TV commercials, movie trailers and other promotional content from TV. At the same time, our software analyzes consumer interactions with TV ads on the digital screen across search, video and social. Interactions are matched with specific ads and attributed back to airings on TV. Our platform collects and analyzes massive amounts of data in real-time.
This is a rare opportunity to get equity in the early stages of a company with significant early traction and which is run by an experienced team.
Responsibilities:
As a key member of the custom analytics team, you will be responsible for a variety of business-critical work that includes, but not limited to:
Gathering data from multiple data sources, aggregating and manipulating data for analysis, performing analysis, and creating analysis deliverables in Tableau or other BI tools.
Communicating with internal iSpot teams (including Engineering, Customer Success, and Sales) to clarify requirements, resolve technical roadblocks, manage priorities, and summarize insights from analysis.
Query from large, complex data sets (using a combination of SQL and Python) to get data that is most relevant for analysis related to TV advertisement measurement. Be proficient in knowing how to join and aggregate potentially large data sets to make sense and provide valuable insight. Be curious about results and have a desire to understand how the data tells a story.
Create visualizations and/or tables that organize data in a way that is digestible and makes sense based on the request. Leverage Tableau or other BI tools (Excel, Qlik, etc) to create a customer-ready deliverable.
Work closely with data engineering and other technical experts to ask questions about data accuracy and validity. You should gain a sense for data that potentially doesn’t look right and communicate concerns whenever you see them.
Document project status, updates, roadblocks, resolutions, dependencies, and deliverables in project tracking tool (JIRA).
As part of a very collaborative engineering team, you will have access to technical experts that can help you optimize code, point you to the right data, and brainstorm about how to visualize a data set. You should be an open communicator and have a desire to participate in team discussions and help troubleshoot when you have knowledge that a team member might need.
You will be expected to manage multiple projects at the same time…not too many, but usually not just one. You should be able to communicate roadblocks and risks proactively…we will have your back when you do!
Ideally you have some curiosity for the TV ad measurement space and think that tying ad measurement to business outcomes leads to some very interesting, sometimes exploratory, analysis.

Requirements:
3-5 years of professional experience and bachelor’s degree, including:
3-5 years as a data analyst, focused on hands-on data gathering, analysis, and visualization.
2-3 years in a role that required communication to clarify requirements, summarize results, or advise clients on analysis.
At least 2 years of experience with Tableau or a similar BI tool is required, including high proficiency in data loading, variable creation, visualization creation and adjustment, and report publishing (both online and via desktop or local channels).
Proficiency in SQL, and R or Python is required. Ability to break down queries to run under processing and memory constraints. You will need to know how to both initiate your own query and also edit/debug an inherited query in some cases.
Must be able to communicate risks and roadblocks for analysis projects to team leads or VP of Reporting and Analytics.
Must be able to communicate status of projects clearly for technical and non-technical audiences and independently manage and prioritize assignments.
Strong attention to detail.
Strong quantitative, analytical, process development, facilitation and organizational skills required.
Ability to multi-task and work well under deadlines in a changing environment.

Semantic Scholar (semanticscholar.org) is a free, AI-powered research tool for scientific literature. We have grown from a groundbreaking research project at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence to a product millions of scholars use every week. Semantic Scholar uses artificial intelligence to extract the semantics, or meaning, of scientific literature and surface it to our users through a discovery experience that helps them understand science more effectively than any other tool.

Since our launch in 2015, we have indexed more than 180 million research papers and built a user base of millions of scholars in over 100 countries. Our work has been featured in the New York Times, Wired, Nature, Science, and many other publications. In March 2020, Semantic Scholar released the CORD-19 dataset, a free resource of over 130,000 scholarly articles about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses for use by the global research community. The dataset is now updated daily and supports dozens of research initiatives around the world.

ABOUT THE ROLE:
You will be an end-to-end owner. You will interact with some of our largest clients to understand their requirements and business goals. Based on their business goals, you will design and build large scale data processing systems, data pipelines, computationally intensive statistical modelling and advanced analytics solutions that incorporate AI or ML models proposed by our data scientists.

At Amazon, we’ve been investing deeply in artificial intelligence for over 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers experience are driven by machine learning. Amazon.com’s recommendations engine is driven by machine learning (ML), as are the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers. Our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are also informed by ML algorithms. Alexa is fueled by Natural Language Understanding and Automated Speech Recognition deep learning; as is Prime Air, and the computer vision technology in our new retail experience, Amazon Go. We have thousands of engineers at Amazon committed to machine learning and deep learning, and it’s a big part of our heritage.

Within AWS, we’re focused on bringing that knowledge and capability to customers through three layers of the AI stack: 1) Frameworks and Infrastructure with tools like Apache MxNet and TensorFlow, 2) Machine Learning Platforms such as Amazon SageMaker for data scientists and 3) API-driven Services like Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Forecast, Amazon Personalize, Amazon Rekognition, Lookout for Equipment, Monitron, Lookout for Metric, Panorama, Lookout for Vision, Health AI, and Amazon Textract to quickly add intelligence to applications with a simple API call.

And, most important - you will act as the steward for developing winning Personalization solutions for our customers.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have twelve employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

BACKGROUND
Emerging technologies are disrupting old paradigms and unleashing new opportunities. Oracle has embedded innovative technologies in every aspect of our cloud, enabling companies to reimagine their businesses, processes, and experiences. And the worldâ€™s #1 database is now autonomous, allowing enterprises to innovate at the speed of a startup.
Artificial intelligence, blockchain, the Internet of Things, machine learning, and other emerging technologies permeate every aspect of work and life. These technologies help us reimagine whatâ€™s possible: self-driving cars, personalized medicine, precision agriculture, and smart cities.
Oracle provides essential elements for companies to pioneer innovations and drive new business models. For example, applications based on artificial intelligence (AI) can suggest the next best actions, automate answers, and provide personalized service. Oracle embeds machine learning into several management and security offerings to help monitor, troubleshoot, and predict potential outages and security breaches. We enable automated but personalized interactions across our applications via digital assistantsâ€”and weâ€™ve integrated AI into analytics to help discover hidden patterns.
Oracle helps customers develop roadmaps, migrate to the cloud, and take advantage of emerging technologies from any point: new cloud deployments, on-premises environments, and hybrid implementations.
Oracleâ€™s approach makes it easy for companies to get started in the cloud and even easier to expand as business grows.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: Oracle set an ambitious goal in building its second-generation cloud infrastructure: to create an infrastructure that matches and surpasses the performance, control and governance of enterprise datacenters, while delivering the scale, elasticity, and cost-savings of public clouds. The result, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, is built from the ground up to be an Enterprise Cloud, equally capable of running traditional multi-tiered enterprise applications, high-performance workloads, and modern serverless and container-based architectures.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure serves as the foundational layer for Oracle Autonomous Database, as well as for Oracleâ€™s platform and application services. It is a second-generation cloud infrastructure designed to run any enterprise application and workload securely in the cloud. In a single offering, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure combines the flexibility and cost benefits of a public cloud with the predictability and control of an on-premises environment.

Amazon is looking for a Product Manager to manage the life-cycle of the Reliability Maintenance Engineering (RME) Maintenance Automation Platform. The RME Maintenance Automation team supports the business through the integration and development of higher level software systems, realizing an Industry 4.0 vision for the function. At a basic level, these systems link our low-level automation systems with the cloud and we work at the cutting edge of all aspects of the automation pyramid, from device level to the enterprise level. The more complex systems are leveraging Machine Learning and Big Data to drive predictive actions, preventing downtime or defects in the material handling equipment and improving the Overall Equipment Effectiveness of the installations.

You drive product discussions. You are able to distill clear requirements from large and diverse sets of customers, partners, vendors, engineering team builders, and regional agencies/business entities. You perform or commission market research, usability studies, and create focus groups to identify best of breed benchmarks and solve customer problems.
You discern which features are essential, can be triaged, as well as which can be omitted altogether. You do not allow software work to be de-scoped to a less than acceptable product. You are an effective negotiator, make smart trade-offs (e.g., time vs. effort vs. features), and drive appropriate schedules. You are willing to readjust priorities to ensure the right customer, technology, and engineering outcomes.
You understand the systems and technologies behind your product, their limitations, scaling factors, boundary conditions, and reasons for architectural decisions (Q. What customer, business, and/or technical assumptions have been made?). Depending on the types of customers and the type of product you manage, you may define technical requirements (e.g., APIs, algorithms).
You use your technical judgment to test assumptions and know when to enlist Senior/Principal Engineer reviews to ensure our solutions will scale to meet “think big” business ideas. You know how and when to escalate without damaging relationships. When confronted with discordant views, you are able to find the best way forward and influence others to follow that path (build consensus).
You are a simplifier. You determine when it is appropriate to build, improve an existing solution, or integrate existing features for a more cohesive end-to-end customer experience. You are able to evaluate whether a product to be launched meets the intent of the Press Release and Working Backward documents.
You influence technical priorities and business strategy through data-driven contributions.
You are capable of articulating when a new technology is needed (and when it is not) or discuss the differences between two technology offerings. You proactively mitigate risks and help reduce a product’s exposure to classic failure modes (e.g., requirements not sufficiently understood, ineffective cross-team collaboration, APIs not protected, insufficient testing).
You actively recruit and develop others, improving their skills and ability to get things done. You mentor and coach on product management best practices.
MBA or advanced quantitative/technical degree.
Demonstrated analytical skills, ability to use quantitative and qualitative data to back up assumptions and develop business cases.
