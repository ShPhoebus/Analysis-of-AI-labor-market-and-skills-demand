We dive deep with industry leaders to solve problems and unblock industries, enabling them to capitalize on new digital business models. Simply put, our goal is to use the skill and scale of AWS to make the benefits of a connected world achievable for all businesses.

We are looking for Solutions Architects obsessed with customer success, passionate about simplification and design-thinking and excited to dive deep into the growth opportunity of delivering new product categories to new customer types in an emerging technology space.

In this role, you will manage the full lifecycle of a massive, complex, cross-functional program which requires anticipating (and de-risking) bottlenecks, managing escalations, making smart (data informed) tradeoff decisions, and balancing the customer and business needs within our technical constraints. As a technology program owner, you’re accountable for both the technology strategy’s development and its execution.

An ideal candidate will be entrepreneurial, innovative (both with technology and in getting things done), and highly influential. They will love using technology to solve complex problems in a high-growth environment with a passionate and engaged team and advocating for the needs of our 21 million customers. The ideal candidate will have strong communication, organization and planning skills. They will be able to implement and improve repeatable program frameworks leveraging methodologies like scaled agile or hybrid frameworks that make multiple teams come together to deliver the value.

Drive the creation of scalable, cross-cutting, solutions from concept to delivery with your cross-functional technology partners; you’ll be able to zoom into the weeds of a solution or back out to the SVP-level to communicate constraints and outcomes.
Create plans that have clear, measurable success criteria, and clearly communicate progress and outcomes.
Create roadmaps and plans that have a clear series of milestones, measurable success criteria, and clearly communicate progress and outcomes.
Simplify complexity for the team, drive smart tradeoff decisions, and deliver incremental value.
Force multiply the efforts of many teams to deliver impact by removing bottlenecks before they become roadblocks, optimizing working models, and instrumenting repeatable processes.
Own the prevention of traditional failures: bad understanding of the customer/business problem, weak collaboration, interdependencies not being mapped, weak technical solutioning (debt), gaps in testing, or unclear success measurement.
Communicate and align with senior leadership, both within the Engineering and Product organizations. You will effectively paint with context and drive high quality decisions.

What You’ll Need:

A track-record of delivering complicated software solutions (products, systems, features) in an scaled agile environment.
Understanding how distributed systems and software solutions are built to help guide the product development peer group.
Strong written and verbal communication skills
An entrepreneurial mindset, with a bias for customer focused innovation.
Excellent analytical skills with demonstrated experience turning data into actionable insights.

In this role, you will manage the full lifecycle of a massive, complex, cross-functional program which requires anticipating (and de-risking) bottlenecks, managing escalations, making smart (data informed) tradeoff decisions, and balancing the customer and business needs within our technical constraints. As a technology program owner, you’re accountable for both the technology strategy’s development and its execution.

An ideal candidate will be entrepreneurial, innovative (both with technology and in getting things done), and highly influential. They will love using technology to solve complex problems in a high-growth environment with a passionate and engaged team and advocating for the needs of our 21 million customers. The ideal candidate will have strong communication, organization and planning skills. They will be able to implement and improve repeatable program frameworks leveraging methodologies like scaled agile or hybrid frameworks that make multiple teams come together to deliver the value.

Drive the creation of scalable, cross-cutting, solutions from concept to delivery with your cross-functional technology partners; you’ll be able to zoom into the weeds of a solution or back out to the SVP-level to communicate constraints and outcomes.
Create plans that have clear, measurable success criteria, and clearly communicate progress and outcomes.
Create roadmaps and plans that have a clear series of milestones, measurable success criteria, and clearly communicate progress and outcomes.
Simplify complexity for the team, drive smart tradeoff decisions, and deliver incremental value.
Force multiply the efforts of many teams to deliver impact by removing bottlenecks before they become roadblocks, optimizing working models, and instrumenting repeatable processes.
Own the prevention of traditional failures: bad understanding of the customer/business problem, weak collaboration, interdependencies not being mapped, weak technical solutioning (debt), gaps in testing, or unclear success measurement.
Communicate and align with senior leadership, both within the Engineering and Product organizations. You will effectively paint with context and drive high quality decisions.

What You’ll Need:

A track-record of delivering complicated software solutions (products, systems, features) in an scaled agile environment.
Understanding how distributed systems and software solutions are built to help guide the product development peer group.
Strong written and verbal communication skills
An entrepreneurial mindset, with a bias for customer focused innovation.
Excellent analytical skills with demonstrated experience turning data into actionable insights.

Excellent written and verbal communication skills, ability to present complex technical information in a clear and concise manner to a variety of audiences, including non-technical.

We're driving ongoing efforts as Amazon reorient its outbound fulfillment systems. Our fulfillment network is radically different from the one we had just five years ago. Today we rely on a greedy per-package cost optimization, which made sense when Amazon fulfilled exclusively via Third Party carriers. But now Amazon fulfills over 50% of units using First party assets from the FC to the customer address (Sort Centers, Middle Mile, Last Mile). With First Party fulfillment, the resources are procured well in advance of demand, and the cost of such resources is mostly sunk. To efficiently use First Party resources, we need to shift from optimizing on a per-package level to a new system that manages the flows in our network. The new system will eliminate manual inputs where possible and expose simpler levers that let us strike a balance between cost, speed, and risk. This space requires a high level of strategy, engagement, execution, and operations to evolve the fulfillment capabilities for the next decade and solve 21st century problem with a 21st century cutting edge technology. This initiative is fundamental to Amazon’s future, and will provide great personal satisfaction and career development as we tackle some of the most intriguing transportation problems.

We are looking for a highly motivated, top notch senior engineering leader with both business and technical acumen to drive this exciting innovation. You will own mission critical systems which model Amazon's transportation network and carrier capabilities/constraints and optimizes the transportation of every single Amazon package. These services improve customer experience by providing better promises and drive fulfillment planning and execution to lower transportation cost. These are highly available, low latency services that scale horizontally and are critical part of Amazon's ordering and fulfillment pipeline. You excel at leading developers and have a track record of building and growing strong engineering teams and fostering a culture of creative problem solving. You will have high standards for yourself and your team. You will drive engineering best practices and be constantly looking for ways to make the systems you own better. You have exceptional written and verbal communication skills, and can comfortably work with customers, technical teams, and senior management to collect requirements, describe features and capabilities, product strategies, and influence technical decision-making.

Here is a brief teaser to what we do: https://bit.ly/3cRtCwr. If you enjoy dealing with high ambiguity, high complexity, and broad scope that will be at the epicenter of customer order fulfillment, come join us!

That’s the essence of roles within our Microsoft Ads team. Every day, we bring our insatiable curiosity and customer obsession to the table, challenging ourselves and each other, to make tomorrow better for the millions of businesses we empower around the globe. As one of Microsoft’s growth businesses, key monetization pillars, and Customer Solution Areas (CSA), we contribute over $10B annual revenue. Our business has had consistent YoY double digit growth, until the entire advertising industry became one of the earliest to see the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Advertising has also been among the first to recover, and there will be long-lasting effects on how businesses operate. We are already in a highly competitive industry, and these additional macro effects introduce more exciting and urgent challenges to continue empowering these businesses through their recovery, and to win in our battle to accelerate growth in our share of wallet and revenue.
Are you ready for that challenge?
XPay is part of the Microsoft Ads team’s portfolio, but the charter and platform are not just for advertisers, but instead to enable delightful payment experiences for businesses and consumers across Microsoft. XPay is reimagining the payment space as we know it, enabling payment capabilities across multiple channels with the promise of value and convenience. XPay is a startup within an enterprise organization – very agile, experiment focused, fast paced, creative and delivering impactful payment solutions for millions of users.
You will shape these products every day, as the CEO for your product portfolio. You will walk in our customers’ shoes – building on engagements with them, you will understand how they are using our product today and what they need from our product tomorrow. You will deeply understand the industry we’re serving, the business we’re in and our competition. You will identify new growth initiatives, craft product vision and the strategy to realize it. You will lead innovation, using data to experiment, learn, and iterate, without fear of failure. You will work across the company with other product groups, as well as across the aisle with other disciplines. We need leaders who can keep the big picture in focus, while being able to dive into the unique engineering challenges we face daily. You will partner with, and inspire, our development team to deliver significant value to our customers and business. Besides working with these technical peers, you will also work well with non-engineering disciplines such as our UX Research/Design/Content, Sales, Support, Marketing, Business Development, Operations, Compliance, Legal and Finance partners – you will leverage and collaborate with them to keep a close pulse on our customers, define best-in-class experiences, evangelize our vision and roadmap externally, take changes to market, and then measure their impact against customer and business goals.
Responsibilities
In this specific position, you will take on the challenge of growing our payments (XPay) portfolio.
XPay is filling a huge gap across the company. The platform enables B2B, B2C, C2C payments in many different products and services across Microsoft. It is the enabler that lights up delightful new payment scenarios and brings in user engagement and stickiness. This is a huge growth area in the industry with a 4T dollar opportunity. We need a leader with the creativity to identify and deliver on new initiatives that will capitalize on these trends and propel new business growth, work with partners across the company and external, work with the regulatory disciplines (many of them) as payments is a highly regulated space and lead the project across a team of PMs.
So, if you are eager to bring your passion and hunger to work every day so that you can empower our customers, and you’re excited to help Microsoft win fans and advocates in the race of advertising and payments, excited about having your results contribute to billions of dollars in revenue,
excited about designing and developing innovative delightful experiences, and truly scalable high-performance services that run in the cloud…

About Productiv

Founded in 2018, by leaders from Google, Amazon, and LinkedIn - Productiv is a rapidly growing Series C start-up that enables enterprises' IT teams to take a data- and analytics-centric approach to understanding and driving adoption of SaaS applications at scale. CIOs at innovative companies like Square, Okta, Equinix, Zoom, Dropbox, Equifax, and Uber trust Productiv for delivering better employee experience, increasing business agility, and driving RoI from their entire portfolio of SaaS applications.

Backed by Tier 1 investors including Accel, Norwest, IVP, Okta and Atlassian, Productiv is a team like no other.

Our Vision
An explosion in enterprise SaaS adoption has led to a rapid increase in both the number of enterprises moving to an all-SaaS world, and the number of SaaS applications being used per company.

Productiv solves these by providing automated and intelligent ways for enterprises to manage and optimize their growing SaaS portfolio while maximizing employee productivity.

To accomplish this, we use our engineering muscle as our biggest advantage. We leverage cutting-edge technologies to build enterprise-grade Saas Management web-applications and backend systems. Oh, and we need great engineers as well (this is where you come in...read on).

"Research Scientist, Robotics - New College Grad",NVIDIA,"Seattle, WA",4.2,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=1f1db319ae9c28d1&fccid=c267f29f0f85e8b8&vjs=3,"We are looking for a Research Scientist, Robotics - New College Graduate:
NVIDIA’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics, and revolutionized parallel computing. More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI — the next era of computing. With the GPU acting as the primary computing device, robots can now perceive and understand the world around them. Today, NVIDIA has transformed into “the AI computing company.” We're looking to grow our company, and build our teams with the smartest people in the world working on diverse aspects of AI. Join us at the frontier of technological advancement!
Robotics is an increasingly exciting field, influenced heavily by recent advances in hardware acceleration through devices such as the modern GPU. These advances have enabled tremendous progress in several areas of robotics, including manipulation, visual recognition, real-time tracking, and learning-based control. Robots are getting increasingly proficient at building 3D maps of their environments, detecting and tracking objects and people as they move through the world, learning controllers from realistic simulation, and understanding commands provided via gestures and natural language.
What you'll be doing:
While our ultimate goal is to reach human-level dexterity, perception, and adaptability, we still have a long way to go. To enable the next generation of robots that can robustly operate in the physical world and interact with people in a natural way, progress is still needed in multiple domains: perception, planning, learning, and control. Moreover, even more importantly, the integration of these individual contributions into complete robot systems opens new challenges.
Toward this goal, the NVIDIA Robotics Research Lab brings together a diverse, interdisciplinary research team working on core robotics topics ranging from control, perception, machine learning, common sense reasoning, task planning, human-robot collaboration, and critical related areas such as deep learning for computer vision, natural language processing and decision making.
The lab focuses on fundamental research questions in robotics and lab members are encouraged to publish their research and open source their code. The lab hosts numerous internships every year to foster education and communication, and the team is encouraged to collaborate broadly with institutions outside of NVIDIA, both academic and industrial. NVIDIA is well known for its team culture, and lab researchers are able to closely interact with others within the company who are experts in broad subtopics such as computer vision, computer graphics, GPU computing, AI and Deep Learning, self-driving cars, and physics-based simulation.
The following research areas are of particular interest:
Robot manipulation, robot control, reinforcement learning, computer vision, human-robot interaction, deep learning, physics-based simulation, neuro symbolic reasoning, and natural language processing.
What we need to see:
Pursuing PhD in Robotics, Computer Science, Engineering or related field.
3+ years of relevant research or work experience
Knowledge of theory and practice of robotics, or a related area with a strong interest in connecting your work to robotics scenarios.
A track record of research excellence with your work published in top conferences and journals such as Robotics (RSS, ICRA, IROS, CoRL, T-RO, IJRR), Machine Learning (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, JMLR), Computer Vision (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, TPAMI) and Language (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL).
Exceptional programming skills in Python, and deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow and Pytorch. Fluency in C/C++; CUDA and robotics frameworks such as ROS is a plus.
Strong communication and interpersonal skills are required along with the ability to work in a dynamic, research focused team. A demonstrated history of mentoring junior engineers and interns is a huge plus.
Are you dedicated, upbeat and dynamic with excellent analytical ability? Are you a researcher or an engineer passionate and highly motivated about solving complex problems? If so, you may be a perfect fit for NVIDIA!
NVIDIA is committed to fostering a diverse work environment and proud to be an equal opportunity employer. As we highly value diversity in our current and future employees, we do not discriminate (including in our hiring and promotion practices) on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender expression , sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status or any other characteristic protected by law."

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty.


The Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington (APL/UW) is a premier center for research, development and advanced education in science and engineering. APL/UW was formed in 1943 at the request of the U.S. Navy to bring university resources to bear on urgent WWII defense problems. From a wartime beginning focused on effective torpedo exploders, APL/UW initiated acoustic studies and oceanographic research programs to understand how variations in the ocean environment affected the performance of Navy systems. Decades of acoustic and oceanographic studies yielded an understanding of the world's deep oceans.


Today our scientists and engineers make important contributions to understanding the earth's climate cycles with satellite and in situ sensing of ocean winds, currents, and air-sea fluxes; observations of Arctic sea ice, its variations and effects on mid-latitude oceans; and ocean tomography that reveals how the abyssal ocean mixes and sequesters carbon. APL-UW continues to lead research in the basic and applied physics of sound—from sonars used to probe the geology of the deep ocean floor to hand-held high-frequency focused ultrasound devices to image and stop internal bleeding without surgery.


Diversity is a core value at University of Washington and the Applied Physics Laboratory shares this commitment.

Our recipe includes love of all people, thriftiness, and targeting the root causes of poverty to bring about human transformation and fullness of life. With us every 60 seconds a family gets water, a hungry child is fed, and a family gets the tools to overcome poverty.

Start the pursuit of a role that would see you leading major organizational technology initiatives, catalyzing tech and marketing teams, and ultimately changing the world in a life-changing way.

Use your adept ability to discern and translate requirements from marketers, fundraisers, and the like to technologists through vision casting and outlining actionable developer work that consistently delivers solutions and desired results.

Review outgoing new business proposals to ensure sufficient level of strategy budget allocated
Work in partnership with Creative Directors to ensure collaboration and alignment regarding strategy direction and designed deliverables

What you'll bring:

3+ years experience in professional software development, ideally some of which you’ve spent in startups.

Experience with both relational and non-relational databases like DynamoDB, Cassandra, or Elasticsearch and building event-driven systems using message buses and queues like Kafka, SQS, or RabbitMQ.

They are a small founding team with deep experience in fintech infrastructure. They're backed by Gradient Ventures, Box Group, and angels from Uber, Square, Plaid, Robinhood, Index, Coinbase, and Alloy.

You're cool spending the majority of your time writing tests and thinking about how your code can fail.

What you'll bring:

3+ years experience in professional software development, ideally some of which you’ve spent in startups.

Experience with both relational and non-relational databases like DynamoDB, Cassandra, or Elasticsearch and building event-driven systems using message buses and queues like Kafka, SQS, or RabbitMQ.

Comfortable applying computer science theory to real-world concurrent, distributed systems.

Prime, Video, Kindle books, Kindle Unlimited subscriptions, Music, Audible, Apps, In-app purchases, Alexa services are some key products that our customers have come to love. This customer demand continually challenges us to rethink how we might offer and deliver content, to a wide range of devices, in ways that are only limited by our imagination and the imagination of those who want to serve customers using our services. To meet these needs, we are looking for a senior technical leader who can build an innovative engineering organization that will deliver the next generation of subscriptions and membership services at Amazon.

How to design the next generation SDK for making subscriptions commerce smooth and easy? How to design software to be flexible to support various models for fraud detection, credit risk prediction, and cost of payments, while supporting international expansion and new payment methods?

Experienced Tactician – You've been around the technology block on countless occasions and know intuitively when to zig vs when to zag. No matter what the scenario, you have solid real-world experience to help guide yourself and your team down a path to success.
Priority Magician – There's a full deck of issues and IT priorities swirling through the air all around, but you magically pluck the three most critical issues out of the air. You even know how to make a seemingly impossible problem disappear if the situation calls for it.
Security and Compliance Guru – Maybe you brag to your friends about your intricate knowledge of IT standards and compliance issues or maybe you keep that little bit of detail about your day job to yourself. In any case, you understand IT policies, regulations and how to help a organizations meet their security and compliance obligations, including MSPs.
Project Watchtower – You're seeing the pitfalls before they happen and taking the right steps to keep team projects and priorities moving forward. You help your team members stay focused on the true priorities and change direction when necessary.
Critical Eagle Eyes – Flying high above, you naturally notice when something isn't quite right and dive down to validate what the problem is and correct it. Little escapes your watchful eye, and you are quick to validate inconsistencies in reports, process or documentation and take it to the next level.
Natural Born Optimizer – You're tasked with a simple fix but find yourself rebuilding the entire process three times over and saving yourself and your team countless hours down the line.
Buck Stops here – You won't be getting the easy tickets – we've already got two teams to handle those. You'll be getting the tough ones that they couldn't figure out or are taking forever to get done. And your job will be to slice them and dice them and close them out as quickly and efficiently as possible, while comprehensively solving the problem once and for all so no one ever needs to deal with the same issue again.
Calm, Cool, and Collected – You've got it – no matter what “it” is! Your ability to keep your client service and communication skills polished when challenging situations arise will be key to ensuring ongoing client satisfaction.

So what will I be doing every day?

Below is a list of the day-to-day areas of responsibility. You won't be responsible for all of them right from the outset – you'll be working with other members of our team and your responsibility will increase over time.


Team Manager/Leader – You'll set the tone for your team during regular team meetings and recurring one on one conversations with each team member. You know and understand the key metrics that lead to success and regularly influence your team members to achieving them. You are mindful and contribute towards the larger company culture, goals, budgeting, and vision.
Hiring/Training – You'll play a key role in selecting new team members as well as ongoing training and mentoring.
Engineering Project Management – You'll lead the charge in scoping, prioritizing, and implementing engineering team projects and ensuring project goals are being completed accurately, on schedule and high customer satisfaction. You'll also ensure documentation is updated as needed and communication is happening with clients and other teams.
IT Security and Compliance – While IT security needs to be everyone's job at a successful MSP, you'll act as our official compliance officer for our own internal security and compliance needs, making sure we understand and fulfil our own standards and compliance obligations. You'll also interact with clients who need special assistance with IT compliance needs and design changes to how we can support those requirements.
Audits and Standards – Technology changes exponentially faster with new options and solutions on every side. You'll lead the charge in evaluating existing standards and best practices to determine where change is needed to provide the most value. This involves getting into nitty gritty details of the technology to evaluate its full potential, arriving at the best solution for change and scoping that into an achievable plan. You'll have plenty of shiny objects to ignore as you sift through potential new products or setup options and focus our company efforts on big wins and critical changes.
Process Improvement – As a team leader and a technology expert you'll identify broken processes and work diligently to improve them.
Internal Technology Tools – You'll be responsible for managing our internal technology stack to ensure solutions are meeting our needs. Your team members will help with the nuts and bolts of maintaining the systems, but you'll step if there's a serious vendor relationship that needs addressed or changes are needed to meet our needs.
Internal Infrastructure – You'll manage our internal IT infrastructure in terms of design, standards, and annual budgets. You understand that in many ways an MSP is their own worst customer, but you'll strategically use our own network and server resources as a battle ground for testing new technologies and ensuring the solutions we rollout to customers have been effectively tested.

What are the requirements for this position?

Here is a list of our “must-haves” for an Engineering Manager:


Possesses a high level of integrity / honesty - In a small company, each team member relies on their team to complete their job effectively. Mistakes will always be made. It's very important to us to ensure that those mistakes are recognized, admitted, and resolved as quickly as possible when they occur. We don't expect perfection but do expect honesty 100% of the time.
Helpful – Always willing to assist others in a positive manner. This is a back-end support position in nature, so we need someone who's willing to help others and be flexible to change the order of their tasks based on constantly changing priorities. You'll have to be an expert at multi-tasking with the ability to drop what you're doing to attend to urgent issues that may arise.
Challenging yet supportive – someone who sets the bar very high for their team but is also willing to take the time and put in the effort to help them get there.
Reliable – sets the standard for reliability and timeliness for the entire service team.
Excellent technical knowledge – solid understanding of computer systems, networks, and services we provide are critical to this position. Prior experience as a level 2 IT support technician (or higher) is an absolute requirement for this role.
7 years of applicable IT experience - preferably working for an MSP/IT Service Provider primarily handling customer facing tickets, projects, or escalations.
4 Year (Bachelor's) preferred. AA or Technical degree in Information Systems, Cyber Security, Networking, or equivalent experience
MCSA or equivalent Microsoft Certification for the latest Windows Desktop and Server operating systems.
Significant Windows Server and networking experience, including Group Policy Management, Azure AD, Office365 administration, SharePoint Online administration, and Exchange Online administration.
Scripting and automation experience in multiple languages including but not limited to PowerShell, visual basic script, windows command line, and Kaseya.
Experience working in an ITSP/MSP environment and designing scalable, manageable, and efficient solutions and standards for a variety of IT environments. Experience administering an RMM platform is a plus.
Experience administering firewalls, networking equipment and wireless systems including certifications.

What do I get for all my hard work?

Good question! Here's the scoop on this position:

Money - The compensation for this position is market competitive and will be dependent upon experience and expertise. After a few months, you'll be eligible for our bonus program, which gives you the opportunity to earn an additional 10% of your salary each quarter.
Time - We'd like 40 hours/week from you. It might be 45 some weeks, but hopefully not too often. We'll try our best not to have it hit 50. And you'll keep a roughly business hours schedule (we're open 8:30 am - 5:00 pm).
Medical – We pay 100% of your medical insurance! (We're not kidding). We'll also contribute to your HSA account after you've been here for 6 months, and we'd encourage you to do the same (not to mention that you get a tax break for doing so).
Disability – We also pay 100% of the cost of a short and long-term disability insurance policy for you – it ensures that you continue to receive income if you get hurt and are unable to work.
Retirement – We provide a Simple IRA retirement plan, matched dollar per dollar for up to the first 3% of your salary, and you'll become eligible after 6 months of employment.
Paid holidays – You'll get paid for 9 holidays without even showing up to work! You'll get to pick either MLK or President's Day, plus Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day & following Friday, two days at Christmas, and New Year's Day.
Additional PTO – You get 15 additional paid personal days off per year – you can use them if you're sick or for a vacation.
Transit Pass – You'll get an ORCA card that entitles you to free transit on the bus, train, light rail and more that you can use to get to work (and for your personal use).

How do I apply?

No phone calls or recruiters please. If you're serious about this job, please tell us ""why"" you're the person we're looking for. We're looking forward to learning more about you!

Thanks for taking the time to read our novel of a job posting. We hope you are as excited about this opportunity as we are!"

For detailed information on Benefits for this position, click here.


As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem-solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.


UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty.


The Ocean Engineering (OE) team at the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington is hiring – see yourself at APL!


The Applied Physics Laboratory is a research unit at the University of Washington. Our research expertise is in ocean physics and engineering, ocean and medical acoustics, polar science, environmental remote sensing, and signal processing. We conduct research and development that is sponsored by a variety of federal and state agencies, and take great pride in our long-standing status as a US Navy-designated University Affiliated Research Center (UARC). Our work takes place not only on the University of Washington campus and medical centers, but in field locations around the world – at sea, in the air, and on polar ice caps. We apply rigorous scientific inquiry and engineering excellence in pursuit of solutions to important problems for the good of our region, nation, and world.


Diversity is a core value at University of Washington and the Applied Physics Laboratory shares this commitment. We are focused on building and sustaining an inclusive and equitable research environment for all students, staff, and collaborators. We believe every member on our team enriches our community by exposing us to a broad range of ways to understand and engage with the world, identify challenges, and to discover, design and deliver solutions.


The Ocean Engineering (OE) department within the APL conducts engineering design, development, and field operations in support of fundamental and applied research programs sponsored by Federal, State, local and private entities. The work of the Applied Physics Laboratory is innovative. Our sponsors seek novel solutions to research problems, at times within tight timeframes for response. The platforms we create may be the first of their kind. There may not be reference points in existing technology for our work, or the way our sponsors wish to apply existing technology.


The technology we create is often deployed in remote locations which cannot be readily accessed. For example, an instrument may be deployed at sea, at depths of 2000 meters, and, the environmental conditions in which our instruments are deployed are typically harsh, for example, in salt water (which degrades materials and causes electronics to malfunction), at depth in the sea (where the effects of pressure on instruments is much more intense than on land), or around polar ice caps (subject to extreme cold temperatures, freezing and thawing). Not only must we design and fabricate instruments with great precision and reliability, we must also ensure they will function with high reliability under very hostile conditions.


The Applied Physics Laboratory has an outstanding full time opportunity for a Robotics Software Engineer.


This Robotics Software Engineer supports the design, development, and deployment of sensors and platforms to extend the capabilities of underwater robotics. This position will be primarily funded from a range of Federal sponsors (e.g., the Office of Naval Research, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or the Naval Facilities Engineering Command).


The person selected for this Robotics Software Engineer role will be a part of a dynamic team that supports APL’s wide-reaching research enterprise. Your expertise will enable the success of researchers who are clearing hazardous seafloor debris from coastal areas, developing ultrasound technologies that advance medical care, conducting fieldwork on glaciers, polar regions, and the world’s oceans, and performing robotic exploration beneath oceanic ice shelves and on space missions.


RESPONSIBILITIES:


The incumbent will complete discrete tasks for which the PI has closely defined the scope and steps necessary for successful completion. This position and the PI may each take responsibility for portions of a project and solve the research problem through their combined efforts.

Software development. The incumbent will perform all phases of the software development lifecycle, to include design, development, testing/debugging, operation, and documentation.

Electrical and mechatronic design: The incumbent will be responsible for design, development, testing and documentation of novel sensor and robotic systems.

System and experiment design: The incumbent will perform high-level system and experiment design to achieve project goals.

Research proposals. The incumbent will contribute to the PI’s efforts to identify and lead proposals for new research projects and funding, and may also do so independent of the PI.


REQUIREMENTS:

Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related field and at least three years of relevant experience.

Complex software design, development, testing, operation, and documentation.

Excellent attention to detail.

Excellent and creative/novel problem-solving skills

Excellent verbal and written communication skills.

Must be capable of working at sea in small to large vessels for extended periods (days to weeks) and willing to perform such duties.

Ability to work independently, and as a part of a research team, interacting cooperatively with people from diverse backgrounds, academic levels, and nationalities.

Identifying and leading or significantly contributing to external requests for funding.

Must be US citizen capable of obtaining and maintaining a DoD security clearance.


Equivalent education/experience will substitute for all minimum qualifications except when there are legal requirements, such as a license/certification/registration.


DESIRED:

Master's degree in Computer Science or related field

Prior experience working with:

Embedded systems development
Mechatronics
Robotics, UUVs, AUVs, or ocean gliders
