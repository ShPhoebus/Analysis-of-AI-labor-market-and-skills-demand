Job summary
An information-rich and accurate product catalog is a strategic asset for Amazon. It powers unrivaled product discovery, informs customer buying decisions, offers a large selection, and positions Amazon as the first stop for shopping online. We use data analysis and statistical and machine learning techniques to proactively identify and fix item-item relationships within the Amazon product catalog. This problem is challenging due to sheer scale (billions of products in the catalog), diversity (products ranging from electronics to groceries to instant video across multiple languages) and multitude of input sources (millions of sellers contributing product data with different quality).

Amazon’s Item and Relationship Identity Systems group is looking for an innovative and customer-focused senior applied scientist to help us make the world’s best product catalog even better. We believe that failure and innovation are inseparable twins. In this role, you will partner with technology and business leaders to build new state-of-the-art algorithms, models, and services to infer product-to-product relationships that matter to our customers. You will work in a collaborative environment where you can experiment with massive data from the world’s largest product catalog, work on challenging problems, quickly implement and deploy your algorithmic ideas at scale, understand whether they succeed via statistically relevant experiments across millions of customers.


Experience with fast prototyping.
Experience working effectively with software engineering teams.
Publications at top-tier peer-reviewed conferences or journals.
10+ years of relevant experience in industry and/or academia.
Depth and breadth in state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning technologies.

What We Do, How We Do It
Too often, companies use a piecemeal approach when it comes to screening drivers. They might use one vendor to help recruit. Another to screen. And still another to address the complex world that is compliance. This approach is inefficient, expensive, and redundant. Not to mention, it makes it too easy for things to fall through the cracks.
At Foley, we've built a company that effortlessly manages these three areas under one roof: recruit, screen, comply. Thanks to powerful technology combined with our compliance expertise, we're able to deliver a comprehensive solution to our customers and, as a result, a better overall customer experience.
Where We're Headed
We're always developing new solutions to slay tomorrow's recruitment, screening, and compliance monsters. At the core of these solutions is our vast collection of data—and the many ways to leverage it, whether that's developing software to calculate a company's compliance risk or implementing predictive analytics to identify the best drivers.

Support Specialist,MeetElise,"New York, NY 10017 (Tudor City area)",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=f2f39ffc8f2817e5&fccid=d25a2215b7cc7e38&vjs=3,"About MeetElise

MeetElise is on a mission to revolutionize the housing industry, with the ultimate goal of making good housing more accessible.

Access to affordable housing isn't just a problem - it's a global crisis. An estimated seven million affordable and available rental homes are needed in just the US alone, and no amount of government spending or policy have proven to be effective solutions.

MeetElise uses machine learning to address the underlying cause preventing significant advancements in affordable housing: operational costs. By automating the leasing and management of apartment homes, we're creating a new, low cost operating model that allows for the development of new housing at scale.

Our first product is an AI leasing agent named Elise that converts 65% more prospective renters to residents than a human leasing agent. She answers questions and schedules tours 24/7 and is so human-like that renters say they're ""here to meet Elise"" when they show up for a tour.

MeetElise is well-funded by VCs, strategic real estate investors, and customers and was started by technical cofounders from MIT and the University of Cambridge.

Our small, courageous team is building the future we want to live in. A future where housing is affordable, powered by technology, and accessible to all.

About The Role

Sometimes clients have questions about how MeetElise works, need a configuration change or would like to report an issue with our product.

When they contact us their expectations are high: they want prompt, courteous service that quickly resolves their issue.

But our systems are complex, each client has their own configuration and working with an AI-powered virtual leasing assistant is a new concept. Sometimes issues can take multiple days and involve multiple teams to fully solve.

Support specialists remove the complexity for our customers. They understand every detail of our systems, know where to find configuration information and are quickly able to find a resolution or provide key information to customers.

In addition to being technical problem solvers they're also adept communicators, able to manage customer expectations while delivering crystal clear communication that takes the sting out of any issues a customer is experiencing.

Through diligent problem solving, exceptional prioritization and super consistent communication Support Specialists turn negatives into positives and clients into advocates for MeetElise.

Understand the problems your team are solving
Understand how engineering works at Wise and what each team and tribe does. From Fraud to Anti Money Laundering teams - there are lots! Don't worry, we'll help you get acquainted

What We Do, How We Do It
Too often, companies use a piecemeal approach when it comes to screening drivers. They might use one vendor to help recruit. Another to screen. And still another to address the complex world that is compliance. This approach is inefficient, expensive, and redundant. Not to mention, it makes it too easy for things to fall through the cracks.
At Foley, we've built a company that effortlessly manages these three areas under one roof: recruit, screen, comply. Thanks to powerful technology combined with our compliance expertise, we're able to deliver a comprehensive solution to our customers and, as a result, a better overall customer experience.
Where We're Headed
We're always developing new solutions to slay tomorrow's recruitment, screening, and compliance monsters. At the core of these solutions is our vast collection of data—and the many ways to leverage it, whether that's developing software to calculate a company's compliance risk or implementing predictive analytics to identify the best drivers.
What It's Like to Work with Us
Diving deep into a niche industry and becoming an expert . . .

"Software Engineer, Integrations",Pinwheel,New York State•Remote,None,"$90,000 a year",Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=6eedad578b4df1c0&fccid=4036f1d790d3b990&vjs=3,"Pinwheel - Building a fairer financial system by unlocking API access to payroll systems.

More than half of Americans have a poor credit score or no score at all. Since most financial institutions rely on traditional credit scoring to assess risk, that means these people can't access affordable financial products. Instead, they resort to high-interest credit cards, payday loans, and trigger overdraft fees to make ends meet — which ultimately push them into deeper cycles of debt.

Pinwheel provides an API platform that makes it easy to connect payroll accounts like ADP and Gusto to any app. By unlocking the wealth of identity, income and employment data that sits in these systems, alongside direct access to paychecks, we can help innovators build the next generation of financial products that increase access for the underserved while improving the businesses of our partner fintechs, banks, and lenders.

Who are we looking for?

We are looking for skilled engineers to join our integrations engineering team. This team is responsible for the core business function of building and maintaining code that interacts with hundreds of different platforms and payroll providers. If you're the type of person that loves to make your own tools that mash together different data sources, you'll be a good fit.

What you will be doing?
Writing new integrations that range from implementing well-documented APIs to enabling clean data access on otherwise tricky, undocumented or unfriendly systems.
Monitoring and supporting live integrations to keep them healthy and up to date as platforms change and evolve.
Working and growing with a team of engineers from different backgrounds and collaborating cross-functionally with product management and operations teams.
What experience, skills, and qualifications are necessary?
Python proficiency (or transferrable scripting language experience).
A decent grasp of how the web works (HTTP, webservers, etc.)
Experience with processing, manipulating, and cleaning data.
BS in Computer Science, Information Sciences or similar.
1-2 years of industry experience.
Why join Pinwheel?
Best Time to Join - Our company is small but well-funded, meaning you get the upside of starting on the bottom floor with minimal risk.
Be a Cultural Founder - You will have an active hand in molding the company culture and being a part of the entrepreneurial journey.
Build Something Revolutionary - Help build the consumer data infrastructure of the future.
Compensation & Benefits
Starting Salary - $90,000
Benefits - Full medical, dental and vision benefits. Unlimited vacation and sick days. 401K plan. Snacks delivered monthly. And so much more!"

What We Do, How We Do It
Too often, companies use a piecemeal approach when it comes to screening drivers. They might use one vendor to help recruit. Another to screen. And still another to address the complex world that is compliance. This approach is inefficient, expensive, and redundant. Not to mention, it makes it too easy for things to fall through the cracks.
At Foley, we've built a company that effortlessly manages these three areas under one roof: recruit, screen, comply. Thanks to powerful technology combined with our compliance expertise, we're able to deliver a comprehensive solution to our customers and, as a result, a better overall customer experience.
Where We're Headed
We're always developing new solutions to slay tomorrow's recruitment, screening, and compliance monsters. At the core of these solutions is our vast collection of data—and the many ways to leverage it, whether that's developing software to calculate a company's compliance risk or implementing predictive analytics to identify the best drivers.
What It's Like to Work with Us
Diving deep into a niche industry and becoming an expert . . .
Continually growing and advancing . . .
Making lifelong friends during the process . . .
That sums up what it's like to work for us. We're a 250+ person company on the verge of explosive growth thanks to our AI-powered technology—and where it's headed with predictive analytics. If you'd like to board our rocket ship, check us out:

What We Do, How We Do It
Too often, companies use a piecemeal approach when it comes to screening drivers. They might use one vendor to help recruit. Another to screen.

Where We're Headed
We're always developing new solutions to slay tomorrow's recruitment, screening, and compliance monsters.

Product Manager – Buildings Decarbonization Software,Rocky Mountain Institute,"Oakland, NY•Remote",4.7,None,Posted18 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=0360e179cc027980&fccid=942c6211cf29d268&vjs=3,"RMI is seeking a Product Manager to fill a new role to architect and lead the development of a user-friendly and robust platform capable of scaling our existing Portfolio Energy Optimization (PEO) analytics tool. RMI is committed to decarbonizing the building sector and scaling the PEO tool has the potential to significantly increase the retrofit rate of commercial buildings, which is critical to realizing a 1.5-degree future. The buildings sector is responsible for 40% of all energy consumption in the USA and we need to see a quadrupling of the current rate of building retrofits to meet this goal.
RMI is a non-profit think-do-scale tank that has a 40-year history of working on clean energy solutions using integrative design solutions. The institute has a track record of incubating successful businesses and organizations, most recently, WattTime, BlackBear Energy, Energy Web Foundation, and REBA. Joining the PEO team now provides an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of commercializing and scaling an emerging business while having the support of RMI’s expertise and network.
Program Overview
RMI’s Portfolio Energy Optimization (PEO) analytics tool has been developed over the past six years and has successfully supported multiple demonstration projects while continuing to expand in capability. The tool produces virtual representations of buildings and uses them to identify cost-effective retrofit packages to decarbonize buildings. The PEO team is staffed with engineers and sustainability experts capable of expanding and troubleshooting the analytics tool. The current analytics tool is already capable of delivering results at one-half the cost of traditional approaches. To impact the market at scale, however, the tool needs to be rearchitected for workflow optimization and evolve into a client-friendly software application containing RMI's engineering and expertise, that can expand beyond RMI’s consultant-led projects and eventually become ubiquitous within the industry enabling sectoral transformation.
Position Overview
As the Product Manager, you will join a small high-performance team as we look to transform our existing consultant-led PEO analytics tool into a robust, consultant-supported, client-friendly software application that results in market transformational deployment cost in support of full commercialization and scaling. You will have the opportunity as part of the leadership team within PEO to shape the vision, the strategy and the implementation pathway that will support a radical reduction in emissions from the commercial building sector. You will report to the Carbon Free Building team’s Managing Director.
RMI has a history of both incubating successful businesses and organizations. Joining the PEO team provides you an opportunity to help commercialize and scale an emerging business while having the support of RMI’s expertise and network. Once key milestones have been met, RMI intends to partially spin-out the business to enable A-round funding to be secured to rapidly expand into targeted markets.

You will be working closely with the research analysts, Traders, Strats and Operations on both strategic initiatives and tactical enhancements. As such strong, two-way communication skills are critical to success in this seat.

We believe hard work pays off in and out of the office. And we’ll help you pursue what matters most to you. Your time. Your goals. Your balance. With minimal travel, unaccrued vacation, bonuses paid every year (yes, even in 2020), and a dedicated training budget, our teammates are rewarded for their efforts and are given the resources they need to succeed.
We take our merit to the bank, not the vision board. By operating in a flat organization, contributors of all levels have access to leadership and mentors of all levels. And supporting employee growth doesn’t end with professional development.

L’Oréal, Staples, Mastercard, and other leading innovators use Ironclad to collaborate and negotiate on contracts, accelerate contracting while maintaining compliance, and turn contracts into critical carriers of operational business intelligence. It’s the only platform flexible enough to handle every type of contract workflow, whether a sales agreement, an HR agreement or a complex NDA. The company was named one of the 20 Rising Stars on the Forbes 2019 Cloud 100 list, and is backed by leading investors like Accel, Y Combinator, Sequoia, and BOND. For more information, visitwww.ironcladapp.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter. Contracts are the atomic unit of business - everything important that a company does involves a contract: sales, purchases, hires, everything. The process for making a contract happen isn’t that different from the software lifecycle: a cross-functional group collaborates on a technical document that essentially needs to be executable - just in a courtroom instead of a computer. Most legal teams are still stuck doing things manually, emailing versions of these documents around seeking approval and revisions with no easy way to automate workflows.

Support Specialist,MeetElise,"New York, NY 10017 (Tudor City area)",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=f2f39ffc8f2817e5&fccid=d25a2215b7cc7e38&vjs=3,"About MeetElise

MeetElise is on a mission to revolutionize the housing industry, with the ultimate goal of making good housing more accessible.

Access to affordable housing isn't just a problem - it's a global crisis. An estimated seven million affordable and available rental homes are needed in just the US alone, and no amount of government spending or policy have proven to be effective solutions.

MeetElise uses machine learning to address the underlying cause preventing significant advancements in affordable housing: operational costs. By automating the leasing and management of apartment homes, we're creating a new, low cost operating model that allows for the development of new housing at scale.

Our first product is an AI leasing agent named Elise that converts 65% more prospective renters to residents than a human leasing agent. She answers questions and schedules tours 24/7 and is so human-like that renters say they're ""here to meet Elise"" when they show up for a tour.

MeetElise is well-funded by VCs, strategic real estate investors, and customers and was started by technical cofounders from MIT and the University of Cambridge.

Our small, courageous team is building the future we want to live in. A future where housing is affordable, powered by technology, and accessible to all.

About The Role

Sometimes clients have questions about how MeetElise works, need a configuration change or would like to report an issue with our product.

When they contact us their expectations are high: they want prompt, courteous service that quickly resolves their issue.

But our systems are complex, each client has their own configuration and working with an AI-powered virtual leasing assistant is a new concept. Sometimes issues can take multiple days and involve multiple teams to fully solve.

Support specialists remove the complexity for our customers. They understand every detail of our systems, know where to find configuration information and are quickly able to find a resolution or provide key information to customers.

In addition to being technical problem solvers they're also adept communicators, able to manage customer expectations while delivering crystal clear communication that takes the sting out of any issues a customer is experiencing.

Through diligent problem solving, exceptional prioritization and super consistent communication Support Specialists turn negatives into positives and clients into advocates for MeetElise.
