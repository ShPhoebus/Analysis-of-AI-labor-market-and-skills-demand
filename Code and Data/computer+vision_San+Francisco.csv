ROLE OVERVIEW

Over the next 10 years, biotech will fundamentally rewrite the way we live. Gene editing and cell therapy will dramatically change how we treat cancer and other major illnesses. Biofuels and biomaterials will transform the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, and the makeup of everyday objects. Crop science and synthetic biology will produce sustainable and ethical food. Benchling’s mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this future, and magnify its impact, through modern software.

Every day, scientists around the world use Benchling in their efforts to solve humanity's most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research.

Benchling’s suite of unified applications are mission critical in the day-to-day work of scientists, and we strive to ensure that the core functionality and workflows in the applications they depend on are always functional and performant. As a Software Engineer on the Quality Engineering team, your focus will be on accelerating the development of automated end-to-end test suites to help protect that functionality and performance. The automation you create will target modern web-based applications such as a digital Notebook, Molecular Biology, Registry, Inventory, Requests, Workflows, and Insights.

You’ll be embedded within the Quality Engineering scrum team and partner with application scrum teams to define suites of prioritized automated tests covering frontend UI or backend API functionality & performance. You’ll implement the highest priority tests for new and existing scenarios first, while helping the teams maintain their overall backlog of test automation across all priorities. You’ll parter with our Customer Success team to define the most critical customer workflows across our product and create automation to ensure those workflows always work in production. You’ll help define, update, and maintain test automation best practices across frameworks.


Our test frameworks are code focused and not DSL based. We use JavaScript/TypeScript and Cypress for our frontend test cases and Python for test setup. We use Python and Nose for our backend test cases. Depending on your interest and aptitude, you may also contribute to our test infrastructure as we scale our automation efforts over the coming years.

Each application engineer is responsible for the quality and test coverage of the features they ship. Today, engineers create thorough unit test coverage and manually verify feature functionality in a staging environment before releasing to production. Every feature of a given complexity or risk must be shipped with an end-to-end test created by the engineer shipping the feature. You’ll work closely with engineers shipping new features to align on the overall suite of prioritized test automation and add additional coverage as a fast-follow to the test coverage developed during feature development and release.

This is an automation and coding focused role so you’ll need to be fluent in at least one programming language and know how to interact with its common data structures. You’ll need to be productive writing high-quality code that follows coding, automation, framework, architecture and design best practices and patterns. The most successful candidates will be able to demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript for frontend automation or Python for backend automaton.

WHAT YOU WILL WORK ON

Review product requirements, technical plans, and explore existing product functionality to define test coverage
Create end-to-end UI or API automated tests and help maintain a prioritized automation backlog
Trace automated tests to functional requirements for the Validation Engineering team’s Operational Qualification
Review and provide feedback for test automation code reviews from other quality and software engineers
Utilize engineering and framework best practices to create reliable and maintainable test code
Drive teams to increase test coverage and increase quality through test automation
Work in an Agile engineering environment

YOU

Proficient in JavaScript for frontend automation or Python for backend automation
Passionate about protecting application quality by creating flake-free and well designed test automation

About Us

UpTogether is a national organization of individuals across the country with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities who share a passion for social justice and racial equity. Our mission is to recognize, highlight and invest in the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of people in historically undervalued communities and partner with government and philanthropy to do the same.
After working with thousands of families since our founding in 2001, at UpTogether, we are certain people don’t live in poverty because they are lazy, uneducated, or mismanage money, as stereotypes would indicate. Instead, the poverty cycle, which disproportionately impacts Black and Latinx communities, can be traced to well-intentioned but inadequate governmental and charitable policies and practices that rely on a traditional top-down approach.
UpTogether’s Strengths Based Approach (SBA) includes:

Community: We center our work around the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Capital: We invest in our members with unrestricted cash in recognition of the initiatives they are taking to improve their lives.
Choice: We trust that people in undervalued communities know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.

UpTogether reveals and accelerates the initiative people are taking to improve their lives.

As a community, a movement, and a platform, we use the power of information—compelling insights and personal success stories—to transform stereotypes, beliefs, practices, and policies. Together with our members, we are championing a community-led movement to boost economic and social mobility in communities that have been undervalued and underinvested in for far too long.
At UpTogether, we work toward these values:

Community: We honor the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Impact: We test and scale strategies for systems adoption of a strength-based approach to accelerate socioeconomic mobility for people living at or below the poverty line in the U.S.
Collaboration: We center the lived experiences of families in undervalued communities and engage the knowledge, experience, and perspectives of our board, partners, and staff to build and grow a strength-based approach to end poverty.
Racial Equity: We are committed to being an anti-racist organization, and we promote anti-racist policies that eliminate the racial wealth divide.
Leadership: We acknowledge that leadership is not based on a title and honor the many forms in which it appears. We celebrate leadership that embodies all of our organizational values, driving us to act against the dominating deficit-based approach to fighting poverty.
Choice: We trust that people living at or below the poverty line know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.

Software Engineer,UpTogether,"Oakland, CA 94612•Remote",None,"$100,000 - $120,000 a year",Posted29 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=874e5b7fb85dee66&fccid=d53324caf3a824f6&vjs=3,"Software Engineer
About Us

UpTogether is a national organization of individuals across the country with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities who share a passion for social justice and racial equity. Our mission is to recognize, highlight and invest in the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of people in undervalued communities and partner with government and philanthropy to do the same.
After working with thousands of families since our founding in 2001, at UpTogether, we are certain people don’t live in poverty because they are lazy, uneducated, or mismanage money, as stereotypes would indicate. Instead, the poverty cycle, which disproportionately impacts Black and Latinx communities, can be traced to well-intentioned but inadequate governmental and charitable policies and practices that rely on a traditional top-down approach.
UpTogether’s Strengths Based Approach (SBA) includes:

Community: We center our work around the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Capital: We invest in our members with unrestricted cash in recognition of the initiatives they are taking to improve their lives.
Choice: We trust that people in undervalued communities know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.

UpTogether reveals and accelerates the initiative people are taking to improve their lives.

As a community, a movement, and a platform, we use the power of information—compelling insights and personal success stories—to transform stereotypes, beliefs, practices, and policies. Together with our members, we are championing a community-led movement to boost economic and social mobility in communities that have been undervalued and underinvested in for far too long.
At UpTogether, we work towards these values:

Community: We honor the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Impact: We test and scale strategies for systems adoption of a strength-based approach to accelerate socioeconomic mobility for people living at or below the poverty line in the U.S.
Collaboration: We center the lived experiences of families in undervalued communities and engage the knowledge, experience, and perspectives of our board, partners, and staff to build and grow a strength-based approach to end poverty.
Racial Equity: We are committed to being an anti-racist organization, and we promote anti-racist policies that eliminate the racial wealth divide.
Leadership: We acknowledge that leadership is not based on a title and honor the many forms in which it appears. We celebrate leadership that embodies all of our organizational values, driving us to act against the dominating deficit-based approach to fighting poverty.
Choice: We trust that people living at or below the poverty line know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.


The Position

UpTogether is seeking a full-time Software Engineer to support the development of our technology platform, UpTogether. We are looking to turn UpTogether into the operating system of a new social safety net that invests in people based on strengths rather than deficits.
UpTogether is a capital exchange network where social investors (philanthropic and government) make financial capital investments in low-income members on the platform, and members invest in each other, giving and receiving help and support in their communities that we refer to as social capital.
While we use a number of technologies (listed below), specific knowledge of each technology is less important than a strong grasp of core engineering concepts (MVC, OO, REST, etc.) and an eagerness to always be learning new languages, frameworks, and techniques!
This is a 100% remote position (must be based in the United States), so the successful candidate will have a solid internet connection and functional work environment. Employees are responsible for furnishing their own workspace, but a small technology stipend is available. Minimal travel will be required.
Our infrastructure leverages:

AWS; including EC2, S3, Lambda
Linux/Ubuntu
Python and Flask
Javascript and Vue
PostgreSQL
Graphql
GIT
Docker
Requirements (one of these):

Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science/Engineering + 2 years experience
Code camp + 4 years experience
Don't meet these requirements or are self taught? Tell us why you'd be a great fit!
Ideal Candidate:

Ability and willingness to learn new technologies as needed
Self-starter who wants to spend the majority of their time building things
Be involved in all phases of a project (design, build, test, deploy, and maintain)
Personal connection to UpTogether’s mission. Understand what we're trying to do, and be excited to be a part of it!
Be excited and energized by a dynamic work environment.


The Team

You will be working on a growing technology team composed of full-stack engineers and data scientists, and user experience researchers. We are very active on Slack and are focused not only on doing meaningful work, but also enjoying the process of working and building together.
Compensation

This is a full-time position with a competitive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision, 401(k), and vacation. Salary is commensurate with experience, between $100,000 and $120,000 annually.
Inclusion Statement
We strive to create a community that embraces equity, diversity, and inclusion, and we support the efforts of others to build such communities. We encourage all qualified and interested persons to apply, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.
To Apply

Software Engineer,UpTogether,"Oakland, CA 94612•Remote",None,"$100,000 - $120,000 a year",Posted29 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=874e5b7fb85dee66&fccid=d53324caf3a824f6&vjs=3,"Software Engineer
About Us

UpTogether is a national organization of individuals across the country with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities who share a passion for social justice and racial equity. Our mission is to recognize, highlight and invest in the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of people in undervalued communities and partner with government and philanthropy to do the same.
After working with thousands of families since our founding in 2001, at UpTogether, we are certain people don’t live in poverty because they are lazy, uneducated, or mismanage money, as stereotypes would indicate. Instead, the poverty cycle, which disproportionately impacts Black and Latinx communities, can be traced to well-intentioned but inadequate governmental and charitable policies and practices that rely on a traditional top-down approach.
UpTogether’s Strengths Based Approach (SBA) includes:

Community: We center our work around the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Capital: We invest in our members with unrestricted cash in recognition of the initiatives they are taking to improve their lives.
Choice: We trust that people in undervalued communities know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.

UpTogether reveals and accelerates the initiative people are taking to improve their lives.

As a community, a movement, and a platform, we use the power of information—compelling insights and personal success stories—to transform stereotypes, beliefs, practices, and policies. Together with our members, we are championing a community-led movement to boost economic and social mobility in communities that have been undervalued and underinvested in for far too long.
At UpTogether, we work towards these values:

Community: We honor the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Impact: We test and scale strategies for systems adoption of a strength-based approach to accelerate socioeconomic mobility for people living at or below the poverty line in the U.S.
Collaboration: We center the lived experiences of families in undervalued communities and engage the knowledge, experience, and perspectives of our board, partners, and staff to build and grow a strength-based approach to end poverty.
Racial Equity: We are committed to being an anti-racist organization, and we promote anti-racist policies that eliminate the racial wealth divide.
Leadership: We acknowledge that leadership is not based on a title and honor the many forms in which it appears. We celebrate leadership that embodies all of our organizational values, driving us to act against the dominating deficit-based approach to fighting poverty.
Choice: We trust that people living at or below the poverty line know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.


The Position

UpTogether is seeking a full-time Software Engineer to support the development of our technology platform, UpTogether. We are looking to turn UpTogether into the operating system of a new social safety net that invests in people based on strengths rather than deficits.
UpTogether is a capital exchange network where social investors (philanthropic and government) make financial capital investments in low-income members on the platform, and members invest in each other, giving and receiving help and support in their communities that we refer to as social capital.
While we use a number of technologies (listed below), specific knowledge of each technology is less important than a strong grasp of core engineering concepts (MVC, OO, REST, etc.) and an eagerness to always be learning new languages, frameworks, and techniques!
This is a 100% remote position (must be based in the United States), so the successful candidate will have a solid internet connection and functional work environment. Employees are responsible for furnishing their own workspace, but a small technology stipend is available. Minimal travel will be required.
Our infrastructure leverages:

AWS; including EC2, S3, Lambda
Linux/Ubuntu
Python and Flask
Javascript and Vue
PostgreSQL
Graphql
GIT
Docker
Requirements (one of these):

Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science/Engineering + 2 years experience
Code camp + 4 years experience
Don't meet these requirements or are self taught? Tell us why you'd be a great fit!
Ideal Candidate:

Ability and willingness to learn new technologies as needed
Self-starter who wants to spend the majority of their time building things
Be involved in all phases of a project (design, build, test, deploy, and maintain)
Personal connection to UpTogether’s mission. Understand what we're trying to do, and be excited to be a part of it!
Be excited and energized by a dynamic work environment.


The Team

You will be working on a growing technology team composed of full-stack engineers and data scientists, and user experience researchers. We are very active on Slack and are focused not only on doing meaningful work, but also enjoying the process of working and building together.
Compensation

This is a full-time position with a competitive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision, 401(k), and vacation. Salary is commensurate with experience, between $100,000 and $120,000 annually.
Inclusion Statement
We strive to create a community that embraces equity, diversity, and inclusion, and we support the efforts of others to build such communities. We encourage all qualified and interested persons to apply, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.
To Apply

To be considered for this opportunity, please submit a resume and cover letter via this link: Apply Here. Your cover letter should outline how your personal and/or work history will contribute to the mission of UpTogether. Applications submitted without a cover letter will not be considered."

At 0x Labs, our mission is to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely. We're a highly technical, globally distributed group of teams working together toward actualizing that mission.

Our Client


Moving and tracking money is a slog, they make it easy. Building a compliant back-end can be a year’s long process that requires a team of accountant engineers, integration with your money moving stack, and lots of work making everything idempotent, traceable, and fault-tolerant. Like what Square, Robinhood, and Uber did. Our client provides the same features in an API.
They are a small founding team with deep experience in fintech infrastructure. They're backed by Gradient Ventures, Box Group, and angels from Uber, Square, Plaid, Robinhood, Index, Coinbase, and Alloy.
If you enjoy working with ambitious peers, reducing hard problems to their constituent parts, and changing how markets get built, we’d love to hear from you.

You'll help assess, hire and mentor your future team.

Write technical blog posts (e.g. ""here's how to build an SMB lending app"") and documentation (e.g. if you build a payment NSF error-handler for the said lending app, you'll write the blog, the docs, and design the reference ledger for that vertical).

You're cool spending the majority of your time writing tests and thinking about how your code can fail.

What you'll bring:

3+ years experience in professional software development, ideally some of which you’ve spent in startups.

Experience with both relational and non-relational databases like DynamoDB, Cassandra, or Elasticsearch and building event-driven systems using message buses and queues like Kafka, SQS, or RabbitMQ.

Familiarity with serverless or micro-services architectures and deployment tools like CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or Serverless Framework.

Comfortable applying computer science theory to real-world concurrent, distributed systems.

A customer-first mindset and an interest in talking with customers to make sure what we’re building meets their needs.

Able to own the entire lifecycle of a feature, work with customers to design the API, write the docs, and help customers adopt and operate it.

What we'll bring

Health and wellbeing

Our cleint offers top-of-the-line benefits, including health, dental, and vision insurance.

Time off

THey want people to take time off to rest and rejuvenate. Our client offers unlimited paid vacation as well as 10 observed holidays by country.

founding team equity

. The salary range is $180k - $230k. They aree fully remote with the founders in Austin and Seattle. They can set up a multi-round interview process or start on a contract basis in the next 1-2 weeks and if they see a mutual fit, they'll offer a full-time founding role."

Software Engineer,UpTogether,"Oakland, CA 94612•Remote",None,"$100,000 - $120,000 a year",Posted29 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=874e5b7fb85dee66&fccid=d53324caf3a824f6&vjs=3,"Software Engineer
About Us

UpTogether is a national organization of individuals across the country with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities who share a passion for social justice and racial equity. Our mission is to recognize, highlight and invest in the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of people in undervalued communities and partner with government and philanthropy to do the same.
After working with thousands of families since our founding in 2001, at UpTogether, we are certain people don’t live in poverty because they are lazy, uneducated, or mismanage money, as stereotypes would indicate. Instead, the poverty cycle, which disproportionately impacts Black and Latinx communities, can be traced to well-intentioned but inadequate governmental and charitable policies and practices that rely on a traditional top-down approach.
UpTogether’s Strengths Based Approach (SBA) includes:

Community: We center our work around the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Capital: We invest in our members with unrestricted cash in recognition of the initiatives they are taking to improve their lives.
Choice: We trust that people in undervalued communities know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.

UpTogether reveals and accelerates the initiative people are taking to improve their lives.

As a community, a movement, and a platform, we use the power of information—compelling insights and personal success stories—to transform stereotypes, beliefs, practices, and policies. Together with our members, we are championing a community-led movement to boost economic and social mobility in communities that have been undervalued and underinvested in for far too long.
At UpTogether, we work towards these values:

Community: We honor the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Impact: We test and scale strategies for systems adoption of a strength-based approach to accelerate socioeconomic mobility for people living at or below the poverty line in the U.S.
Collaboration: We center the lived experiences of families in undervalued communities and engage the knowledge, experience, and perspectives of our board, partners, and staff to build and grow a strength-based approach to end poverty.
Racial Equity: We are committed to being an anti-racist organization, and we promote anti-racist policies that eliminate the racial wealth divide.
Leadership: We acknowledge that leadership is not based on a title and honor the many forms in which it appears. We celebrate leadership that embodies all of our organizational values, driving us to act against the dominating deficit-based approach to fighting poverty.
Choice: We trust that people living at or below the poverty line know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.


The Position

UpTogether is seeking a full-time Software Engineer to support the development of our technology platform, UpTogether. We are looking to turn UpTogether into the operating system of a new social safety net that invests in people based on strengths rather than deficits.
UpTogether is a capital exchange network where social investors (philanthropic and government) make financial capital investments in low-income members on the platform, and members invest in each other, giving and receiving help and support in their communities that we refer to as social capital.
While we use a number of technologies (listed below), specific knowledge of each technology is less important than a strong grasp of core engineering concepts (MVC, OO, REST, etc.) and an eagerness to always be learning new languages, frameworks, and techniques!
This is a 100% remote position (must be based in the United States), so the successful candidate will have a solid internet connection and functional work environment. Employees are responsible for furnishing their own workspace, but a small technology stipend is available. Minimal travel will be required.
Our infrastructure leverages:

AWS; including EC2, S3, Lambda
Linux/Ubuntu
Python and Flask
Javascript and Vue
PostgreSQL
Graphql
GIT
Docker
Requirements (one of these):

Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science/Engineering + 2 years experience
Code camp + 4 years experience
Don't meet these requirements or are self taught? Tell us why you'd be a great fit!
Ideal Candidate:

Ability and willingness to learn new technologies as needed
Self-starter who wants to spend the majority of their time building things
Be involved in all phases of a project (design, build, test, deploy, and maintain)
Personal connection to UpTogether’s mission. Understand what we're trying to do, and be excited to be a part of it!
Be excited and energized by a dynamic work environment.


The Team

You will be working on a growing technology team composed of full-stack engineers and data scientists, and user experience researchers. We are very active on Slack and are focused not only on doing meaningful work, but also enjoying the process of working and building together.
Compensation

This is a full-time position with a competitive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision, 401(k), and vacation. Salary is commensurate with experience, between $100,000 and $120,000 annually.
Inclusion Statement
We strive to create a community that embraces equity, diversity, and inclusion, and we support the efforts of others to build such communities. We encourage all qualified and interested persons to apply, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.
To Apply

To be considered for this opportunity, please submit a resume and cover letter via this link: Apply Here. Your cover letter should outline how your personal and/or work history will contribute to the mission of UpTogether. Applications submitted without a cover letter will not be considered."

What if you had the best technical experts in data storage, data protection, security, HPC, and networking offering decades of expertise at no cost to your clients? And what if that enabled you to sell high caliber technology solutions to your clients for their physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructure?

Welcome to Cambridge Computer.

We have a unique business model. We are both technology consultants and technology brokers. We introduce the hottest new technologies to market and we have long-established relationships with all the major IT manufacturers in our industry. Our access enables you to solve client challenges with flagship vendors as well as the up and comers and intelligently compare and contrast those methodologies. Imagine being able to be the only place a client needs to go, never running out of ideas to solve a problem? Yes, we think that’s pretty darn cool too.

Where Do You Fit In?

Do you know how to build relationships with Enterprise IT Clients?
Can You Project Manage Complex Multi-Vendor Solutions?
Do you know how to execute strategy with sales coaches and business partners?
Do you view coaching as a positive and not a negative?
Do you like being supported by a team of people who treat you like family from Day 1? (Disclaimer, family refers to people you like, not the obligatory Aunt or Uncle who shows up for Thanksgiving that tells the same story over and over again and makes an underhanded comment about the “dryness” of the turkey every year)
Can you hunt and farm simultaneously?

In short, working at Cambridge Computer represents an unparalleled opportunity. We are the ultimate brokers in a highly lucrative space, where if you have client relationships, you can move from simply selling 1 or 2 products to a full range of solutions. You can achieve high close rates as each sale is customized to your clients individual needs. We have a host of technical talent available with years of experience who can help design and implement these solutions.

Want to succeed in sales without having that success lead to ever-increasing quotas? Want to work in an organization whose flat structure makes things simple and agile? Looking to break the traditional sales mold and truly serve your clients?

If yes to any of the above, consider this; Cambridge Computer has been in business for 30 years. We are staffed with personnel who on average have been with the company 10+ years. If you make the cut, you would join a group of people who are committed to a cause and not a paycheck. The level of resources and the easy access to them is a unique experience for those who join us. We are a team composed of the best the industry has to offer.

If you think you have what it takes to succeed, read on.

Product Quality Engineer,"Ironclad, Inc.","San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=9da93af9e526693a&fccid=93d7b1a61e6d6bd9&vjs=3,"About Ironclad
Ironclad is the #1 contract lifecycle management platform for innovative companies. L’Oréal, Staples, Mastercard, and other leading innovators use Ironclad to collaborate and negotiate on contracts, accelerate contracting while maintaining compliance, and turn contracts into critical carriers of operational business intelligence. It’s the only platform flexible enough to handle every type of contract workflow, whether a sales agreement, an HR agreement or a complex NDA. The company was named one of the 20 Rising Stars on the Forbes 2019 Cloud 100 list, and is backed by leading investors like Accel, Y Combinator, Sequoia, and Bond. For more information, visit www.ironcladapp.com or follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.
Contracts are the atomic unit of business - everything important that a company does involves a contract: sales, purchases, hires, everything. The process for making a contract happen isn’t that different from the software lifecycle: a cross-functional group collaborates on a technical document that essentially needs to be executable - just in a courtroom instead of a computer. Most legal teams are still stuck doing things manually, emailing versions of these documents around seeking approval and revisions with no easy way to automate workflows. Simple questions like “what is blocking this contract?” can be really difficult to answer since the information is locked in someone’s inbox.

Watch our TV episode with Amazon's CTO at a Norwegian fish farm here! https://youtu.be/YZ_qJ5JFD3I
Our mission
Aquabyte is on a mission to revolutionize the sustainability and efficiency of aquaculture. It is an audacious, and incredibly rewarding mission. By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the sea for generations to come.
We are a diverse, mission-driven team that is eager to work alongside kindred spirits. If this vision makes you smile, gives you goosebumps, or otherwise inspires you please get in touch.
Our product
We are currently focused on helping Norwegian salmon farmers better understand their fish populations and make environmentally-sound decisions. Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application. As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack.
Above all, Aquabyte is a customer-driven company. Our product development is dictated by the needs of fish farmers and we prioritize customer delight in everything we do. We are committed to build a global, collaborative team that creates value far beyond Silicon Valley.
About The Edge Systems Team:
Edge engineering is responsible for the hardware and software orchestrating the hardware installed at fish farms around the world. Our goals are to create autonomous, reliable, bandwidth-light, long-lasting, robust, remote-debuggable, fail-safe, and easily deployable underwater cameras and sensors.
We work with world-class mechanical engineering firms and optical consultants to spec the underwater equipment we deploy. The edge engineering team writes software and procedures to make quality testing of these cameras as easy as possible for the field team in Norway. The types of tests we orchestrate are hardware burn-in, optical quality testing in-air and in-water, sensor calibration and verification, and stereo camera calibration.
The edge team also writes software to make it easy for the field team to successfully deploy and configure our hardware at the farm. As it’s often rainy in Norway and the Internet may not yet be set up, our debugging tools need to operate wirelessly and allow a field technician to interface with the hardware from their phones.
The edge team is responsible for designing the network, cellular backup system, and mesh network of devices at a farm. We plan for failure, and build in redundancies where possible. Internet can go out for hours and there’s only so much data we can uplink. Boats may park between our antennas.
As Aquabyte evolves, more products will be built on-top of the pixel and sensor data we collect. In order to scale, these algorithms need to live on the edge. We work closely with the machine learning team to help move their algorithms safely from the cloud to the edge.
We are responsible for our own Linux build process and the process of safely deploying software to the devices in the field.

About Us

UpTogether is a national organization of individuals across the country with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities who share a passion for social justice and racial equity. Our mission is to recognize, highlight and invest in the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of people in undervalued communities and partner with government and philanthropy to do the same.
After working with thousands of families since our founding in 2001, at UpTogether, we are certain people don’t live in poverty because they are lazy, uneducated, or mismanage money, as stereotypes would indicate. Instead, the poverty cycle, which disproportionately impacts Black and Latinx communities, can be traced to well-intentioned but inadequate governmental and charitable policies and practices that rely on a traditional top-down approach.
UpTogether’s Strengths Based Approach (SBA) includes:

Community: We center our work around the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Capital: We invest in our members with unrestricted cash in recognition of the initiatives they are taking to improve their lives.
Choice: We trust that people in undervalued communities know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.

UpTogether reveals and accelerates the initiative people are taking to improve their lives.

As a community, a movement, and a platform, we use the power of information—compelling insights and personal success stories—to transform stereotypes, beliefs, practices, and policies. Together with our members, we are championing a community-led movement to boost economic and social mobility in communities that have been undervalued and underinvested in for far too long.
At UpTogether, we work towards these values:

Community: We honor the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Impact: We test and scale strategies for systems adoption of a strength-based approach to accelerate socioeconomic mobility for people living at or below the poverty line in the U.S.
Collaboration: We center the lived experiences of families in undervalued communities and engage the knowledge, experience, and perspectives of our board, partners, and staff to build and grow a strength-based approach to end poverty.
Racial Equity: We are committed to being an anti-racist organization, and we promote anti-racist policies that eliminate the racial wealth divide.
Leadership: We acknowledge that leadership is not based on a title and honor the many forms in which it appears. We celebrate leadership that embodies all of our organizational values, driving us to act against the dominating deficit-based approach to fighting poverty.
Choice: We trust that people living at or below the poverty line know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.


The Position

UpTogether is seeking a full-time Software Engineer to support the development of our technology platform, UpTogether. We are looking to turn UpTogether into the operating system of a new social safety net that invests in people based on strengths rather than deficits.
UpTogether is a capital exchange network where social investors (philanthropic and government) make financial capital investments in low-income members on the platform, and members invest in each other, giving and receiving help and support in their communities that we refer to as social capital.
While we use a number of technologies (listed below), specific knowledge of each technology is less important than a strong grasp of core engineering concepts (MVC, OO, REST, etc.) and an eagerness to always be learning new languages, frameworks, and techniques!
This is a 100% remote position (must be based in the United States), so the successful candidate will have a solid internet connection and functional work environment. Employees are responsible for furnishing their own workspace, but a small technology stipend is available. Minimal travel will be required.
Our infrastructure leverages:

AWS; including EC2, S3, Lambda
Linux/Ubuntu
Python and Flask

PostgreSQL
Graphql
GIT
Docker
Requirements (one of these):

Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science/Engineering + 2 years experience

Self-starter who wants to spend the majority of their time building things
Be involved in all phases of a project (design, build, test, deploy, and maintain)
Personal connection to UpTogether’s mission. Understand what we're trying to do, and be excited to be a part of it!
Be excited and energized by a dynamic work environment.


The Team

You will be working on a growing technology team composed of full-stack engineers and data scientists, and user experience researchers. We are very active on Slack and are focused not only on doing meaningful work, but also enjoying the process of working and building together.
Compensation

This is a full-time position with a competitive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision, 401(k), and vacation. Salary is commensurate with experience, between $100,000 and $120,000 annually.
Inclusion Statement

What if you had the best technical experts in data storage, data protection, security, HPC, and networking offering decades of expertise at no cost to your clients? And what if that enabled you to sell high caliber technology solutions to your clients for their physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructure?

Welcome to Cambridge Computer.

We have a unique business model. We are both technology consultants and technology brokers. We introduce the hottest new technologies to market and we have long-established relationships with all the major IT manufacturers in our industry. Our access enables you to solve client challenges with flagship vendors as well as the up and comers and intelligently compare and contrast those methodologies. Imagine being able to be the only place a client needs to go, never running out of ideas to solve a problem? Yes, we think that’s pretty darn cool too.

Where Do You Fit In?

Do you know how to build relationships with Enterprise IT Clients?
Can You Project Manage Complex Multi-Vendor Solutions?
Do you know how to execute strategy with sales coaches and business partners?
Do you view coaching as a positive and not a negative?
Do you like being supported by a team of people who treat you like family from Day 1? (Disclaimer, family refers to people you like, not the obligatory Aunt or Uncle who shows up for Thanksgiving that tells the same story over and over again and makes an underhanded comment about the “dryness” of the turkey every year)
Can you hunt and farm simultaneously?

In short, working at Cambridge Computer represents an unparalleled opportunity. We are the ultimate brokers in a highly lucrative space, where if you have client relationships, you can move from simply selling 1 or 2 products to a full range of solutions. You can achieve high close rates as each sale is customized to your clients individual needs. We have a host of technical talent available with years of experience who can help design and implement these solutions.

Want to succeed in sales without having that success lead to ever-increasing quotas? Want to work in an organization whose flat structure makes things simple and agile? Looking to break the traditional sales mold and truly serve your clients?

If yes to any of the above, consider this; Cambridge Computer has been in business for 30 years. We are staffed with personnel who on average have been with the company 10+ years. If you make the cut, you would join a group of people who are committed to a cause and not a paycheck. The level of resources and the easy access to them is a unique experience for those who join us. We are a team composed of the best the industry has to offer.

What if you had the best technical experts in data storage, data protection, security, HPC, and networking offering decades of expertise at no cost to your clients? And what if that enabled you to sell high caliber technology solutions to your clients for their physical, virtual, and cloud infrastructure?

Welcome to Cambridge Computer.

We have a unique business model. We are both technology consultants and technology brokers. We introduce the hottest new technologies to market and we have long-established relationships with all the major IT manufacturers in our industry. Our access enables you to solve client challenges with flagship vendors as well as the up and comers and intelligently compare and contrast those methodologies. Imagine being able to be the only place a client needs to go, never running out of ideas to solve a problem? Yes, we think that’s pretty darn cool too.

Where Do You Fit In?

Do you know how to build relationships with Enterprise IT Clients?
Can You Project Manage Complex Multi-Vendor Solutions?
Do you know how to execute strategy with sales coaches and business partners?
Do you view coaching as a positive and not a negative?
Do you like being supported by a team of people who treat you like family from Day 1? (Disclaimer, family refers to people you like, not the obligatory Aunt or Uncle who shows up for Thanksgiving that tells the same story over and over again and makes an underhanded comment about the “dryness” of the turkey every year)
Can you hunt and farm simultaneously?

In short, working at Cambridge Computer represents an unparalleled opportunity. We are the ultimate brokers in a highly lucrative space, where if you have client relationships, you can move from simply selling 1 or 2 products to a full range of solutions. You can achieve high close rates as each sale is customized to your clients individual needs. We have a host of technical talent available with years of experience who can help design and implement these solutions.

Want to succeed in sales without having that success lead to ever-increasing quotas? Want to work in an organization whose flat structure makes things simple and agile? Looking to break the traditional sales mold and truly serve your clients?

If yes to any of the above, consider this; Cambridge Computer has been in business for 30 years. We are staffed with personnel who on average have been with the company 10+ years. If you make the cut, you would join a group of people who are committed to a cause and not a paycheck. The level of resources and the easy access to them is a unique experience for those who join us. We are a team composed of the best the industry has to offer.

Experience with C/C++
Experience with Vue.JS, docker, and PostgreSQL
Experience with containerization and service architectures
Experience with video and machine vision systems
Experience with scientific computing or laboratory automation

We have a strong goal-oriented and asynchronous culture, so cogent and pithy writers will flourish.

ROLE OVERVIEW

Over the next 10 years, biotech will fundamentally rewrite the way we live. Gene editing and cell therapy will dramatically change how we treat cancer and other major illnesses. Biofuels and biomaterials will transform the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, and the makeup of everyday objects. Crop science and synthetic biology will produce sustainable and ethical food. Benchling’s mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this future, and magnify its impact, through modern software.

Every day, scientists around the world use Benchling in their efforts to solve humanity's most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research.

Benchling’s suite of unified applications are mission critical in the day-to-day work of scientists, and we strive to ensure that the core functionality and workflows in the applications they depend on are always functional and performant. As a Software Engineer on the Quality Engineering team, your focus will be on accelerating the development of automated end-to-end test suites to help protect that functionality and performance. The automation you create will target modern web-based applications such as a digital Notebook, Molecular Biology, Registry, Inventory, Requests, Workflows, and Insights.

You’ll be embedded within the Quality Engineering scrum team and partner with application scrum teams to define suites of prioritized automated tests covering frontend UI or backend API functionality & performance. You’ll implement the highest priority tests for new and existing scenarios first, while helping the teams maintain their overall backlog of test automation across all priorities. You’ll parter with our Customer Success team to define the most critical customer workflows across our product and create automation to ensure those workflows always work in production. You’ll help define, update, and maintain test automation best practices across frameworks.


Our test frameworks are code focused and not DSL based. We use JavaScript/TypeScript and Cypress for our frontend test cases and Python for test setup. We use Python and Nose for our backend test cases. Depending on your interest and aptitude, you may also contribute to our test infrastructure as we scale our automation efforts over the coming years.

Each application engineer is responsible for the quality and test coverage of the features they ship. Today, engineers create thorough unit test coverage and manually verify feature functionality in a staging environment before releasing to production. Every feature of a given complexity or risk must be shipped with an end-to-end test created by the engineer shipping the feature. You’ll work closely with engineers shipping new features to align on the overall suite of prioritized test automation and add additional coverage as a fast-follow to the test coverage developed during feature development and release.

This is an automation and coding focused role so you’ll need to be fluent in at least one programming language and know how to interact with its common data structures. You’ll need to be productive writing high-quality code that follows coding, automation, framework, architecture and design best practices and patterns. The most successful candidates will be able to demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript for frontend automation or Python for backend automaton.

WHAT YOU WILL WORK ON

Review product requirements, technical plans, and explore existing product functionality to define test coverage
Create end-to-end UI or API automated tests and help maintain a prioritized automation backlog
Trace automated tests to functional requirements for the Validation Engineering team’s Operational Qualification
Review and provide feedback for test automation code reviews from other quality and software engineers
Utilize engineering and framework best practices to create reliable and maintainable test code
Drive teams to increase test coverage and increase quality through test automation
Work in an Agile engineering environment

Machine Learning Engineer,Synapse Financial Technologies Inc,"San Francisco, CA 94105 (Financial District/South Beach area)+1 location",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=dcb40f05565741ee&fccid=e3d1e9ce06e668e2&vjs=3,"We are looking for machine learning engineers to help us build an automated backoffice. In traditional banks, back offices are filled with humans. Their job usually is to verify physical documents (like government issued IDs, proof of address, proof of income documents etc), fill out forms, and search for people on google (no joke) and other sites.
Instead of using people, we want to use machines to do these things. Here is our reasoning behind this: If we can automate the back office, then we won't have costs associated with customers like traditional banks. We would be able to offer state of the art finance products to everyone at a low cost, regardless of their bank balance. (Usually banks charge monthly management fees to people with lower bank balance, aka people with lower socioeconomic status - we want to break that cycle).
Check this out: https://medium.com/synapsefi/insto-instant-account-opening-a2aac88bc0dd. Everything here uses machine learning, from instant government ID verification, to video authentication to social media verification. These are the kind of tools you will be building.
In order to be successful at Synapse, you should have:
An ability to work independently within a small, fast-paced team
An entrepreneurial spirit and unrelenting passion to deliver the best service possible
The ability to implement feedback, learn quickly, and contribute new ideas
A general concern for the wellbeing of others and the desire to work on problems that maximize a positive future for humanity
Key Qualifications:
Experience with Python, with strong love for writing tests
Experience with Tensorflow, PyTorch, Numpy
Experience with working on computer vision or NLP problems
Ability to write clean, reliable code that can be easily maintained
Ability to solve problems and identify areas of improvement
Along with Python, we use flask to build APIs, docker to containerize them, rancher to deploy and orchestrate, AWS to host, CircleCI to test (and obviously Github in between all this). So experience with this stack is a plus, but not a necessity. These things are easy to learn.
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Statistics, Mathematics and/or a related field.
Perks:
Growth Potential
Competitive Salary
Insurance (Health//Dental//Vision)
One Medical membership
401(k) with company matching
Monthly commuter allowance, for travel to and from work
Healthy on-site breakfast and lunch crafted by Synapse’s own chefs

In this role, you will manage the full lifecycle of a massive, complex, cross-functional program which requires anticipating (and de-risking) bottlenecks, managing escalations, making smart (data informed) tradeoff decisions, and balancing the customer and business needs within our technical constraints. As a technology program owner, you’re accountable for both the technology strategy’s development and its execution.

An ideal candidate will be entrepreneurial, innovative (both with technology and in getting things done), and highly influential. They will love using technology to solve complex problems in a high-growth environment with a passionate and engaged team and advocating for the needs of our 21 million customers. The ideal candidate will have strong communication, organization and planning skills. They will be able to implement and improve repeatable program frameworks leveraging methodologies like scaled agile or hybrid frameworks that make multiple teams come together to deliver the value.

Who We Are:

Wayfair believes everyone should live in a home they love. Through technology and innovation, we make it possible for 21 million shoppers to quickly and easily find exactly what they want from a selection of more than 14 million items across home furnishings, décor, home improvement, housewares and more. Partnering with Engineering, Product Management, Experience Design, Analytics and business leaders across Wayfair, our teams ensure that we’re building technology that solves important customer problems in elegant, scalable, and measurable ways.

In This Role, You Will:

Define the mission, vision, and guiding principles for your program (and team) program management office; setting the objectives, analyzing the data to inform decisions, driving outcomes, and influencing the resourcing of your key initiatives.
Drive the creation of scalable, cross-cutting, solutions from concept to delivery with your cross-functional technology partners; you’ll be able to zoom into the weeds of a solution or back out to the SVP-level to communicate constraints and outcomes.
Create plans that have clear, measurable success criteria, and clearly communicate progress and outcomes.
Create roadmaps and plans that have a clear series of milestones, measurable success criteria, and clearly communicate progress and outcomes.
Simplify complexity for the team, drive smart tradeoff decisions, and deliver incremental value.
Force multiply the efforts of many teams to deliver impact by removing bottlenecks before they become roadblocks, optimizing working models, and instrumenting repeatable processes.
Own the prevention of traditional failures: bad understanding of the customer/business problem, weak collaboration, interdependencies not being mapped, weak technical solutioning (debt), gaps in testing, or unclear success measurement.
Communicate and align with senior leadership, both within the Engineering and Product organizations. You will effectively paint with context and drive high quality decisions.

What You’ll Need:

A track-record of delivering complicated software solutions (products, systems, features) in an scaled agile environment.
Understanding how distributed systems and software solutions are built to help guide the product development peer group.
Strong written and verbal communication skills
An entrepreneurial mindset, with a bias for customer focused innovation.
Excellent analytical skills with demonstrated experience turning data into actionable insights.
A BS in computer science or a related technical discipline or MBA with focus on tech and engineering management
5-7 years of experience in software engineering, software product management, software development management, or technical program management.

tl;dr

Spring is accelerating the discovery of therapies for aging and its related diseases. A tight integration of biology and machine learning is at our core, and we're building a rare team of scientists and computational folks working together to accelerate our innovative approach to modeling the biology of aging (in vitro and in vivo) and turning experimental data into therapeutic insight.

Impact

Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we're bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Back office support- support accounts payable, organization of contracts, billing, and compliance paperwork
Travel Logistics- support flights, hotels, transportation, dining, etc. planning for both our remote employees as well as job candidates

Our team

We are building an interdisciplinary team. We don't expect you to have a background in machine learning, just as we don't expect our computer scientists to be expert biologists. We do expect our teams to work closely and learn together day in and day out.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.


A unique opportunity

We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, Susa, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

And at the same time, we're just getting started. You're joining a team that has the funding needed to be ambitious while still early enough to help define our culture, choices, and success. Our expectations of you — and of ourselves — are high.

About You

1+ years of preferably office management or EA experience in either tech or biotech
Ability to adapt quickly to last-minute needs in a diverse, fast-growing startup and execute tasks in a timely and out of the box manner
Excellent organizational, problem-solving, and follow-up skills, as well as the ability to effectively handle multiple priorities while working independently

Today, millions of consumers use Qualia to close on homes every year.

We are hiring entrepreneurial engineers interested in being a part of our rapidly growing engineering team.

Qualia hosts the official Meteor Developer’s Night in our San Francisco HQ, which is the largest gathering of Meteor developers in the world. The event features talks on Meteor and Javascript development generally, often including talks from Qualia team members.
Qualia’s Head of Design, Jack Lukic, is the creator of Semantic UI, one of the most popular open-source design frameworks. Qualia engineers learn this framework, and design patterns more generally, directly from the creator of the framework our front end is built on! Very few companies can say that.
As part of our focus on continual learning and development, a Qualia team member gives an educational talk on something they’re interested in every Thursday to the entire engineering and product team. Topics range from Kolmogorov complexity theory to the definition of art, to models of existential risk.

We believe diverse perspectives and backgrounds are critical to building great technology, and our goal is to cultivate an environment where people feel equally valued and respected. Qualia is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace, and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, age, citizenship, socioeconomic status, disability, or veteran status."

Research Engineer,Span.IO,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/company/Span.IO/jobs/Research-Engineer-b57b523d7b1a0f01?fccid=764e5e1f9b11dc9a&vjs=3,"The MissionThe electrical grid was built to carry electricity unidirectionally from central fossil fuel plants to end consumers. As we transition to a renewable future built from rooftop solar and community storage, the grid itself needs an overhaul. Span's goal is to re-invent the grid from a clean slate to enable that transition, envisioning a grid made of distributed control systems and software as much as copper wires.To accomplish this, we are upgrading the breaker panel — the humble box sitting at the center of every building's electrical wiring — to monitor, control, and make decisions about energy. This converts buildings from passive consumers in a centralized fossil fuel grid to active participants in the emerging distributed energy market.Span's unique commitment to clean-slate ""right architecture"" and our zealotry for top-caliber customer experience position us as domain leaders in envisioning the distributed grid and have allowed us to achieve rapid growth and high visibility in the industry in the two years since we launched.The RoleSpan has two core theses:To solve climate change efficiently and quickly, every building should have a built-in energy management system (EMS)* — i.e. a Linux computer with the ability to measure and control the flow of energy;Buildings with an EMS can be smarter and better to live in than today's buildings.As Span's first research engineer to focus specifically on appliance monitoring, you will help us pursue the dream of #2. We're working on making the EMS into an excellent consumer product. We believe that the data that an EMS has access to — i.e. instantaneous current for every circuit in the house — can give tremendously valuable insights into what's happening in the house. We believe that a good EMS ought to be able to detect appliance failures before they happen; prevent electrical fires; help homeowners operate their houses more efficiently; and act as a guide to homeowners as they go through the journey of electrification.You'll put the rubber to the road for this project, working with Span's data scientists and engineers to research the right algorithms, plan and execute experiments, and build characterization databases. You'll build data acquisition rigs with Span's top-caliber hardware engineers; acquire, install, instrument, and break a variety of appliances; and analyze data and plan experiments with our top-caliber data scientists. You'll balance a program budget (modest to start) and have wide leeway to inform the direction of our research and corresponding feature development. Unlike grad school, you'll be supported by technicians, engineers, and data scientists.Finally, as concepts become fully baked, you'll work with the systems integration, hardware, software, and data teams to implement your findings for our fleet of panels, taking the process full circle from experimentation to application. This might look like writing cloud or device side algorithms, speccing new monitoring tech for future products, or running analysis on the back end to inform strategic business decisions.There are multiple reasons, as we'll discuss in our upcoming inaugural engineering blog post.

From onboarding to creating and updating their product catalog, to improving the merchandising and pricing of individual products - we will be offering guidance and recommending world-class solutions at every step.

Use it to directly and ethically impact the experience of thousands of patients every day and around the world! We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer with creative ideas in artificial intelligence, visual analysis, data storage, security and the production experience to prove it.
What You'll Do
You will work on a variety of innovative and meaningful projects, from developing vision machine learning algorithms for applications such as patient monitoring, to building a training infrastructure for the core machine learning platform. Your solutions will make a significant impact in patients' healing experience and how the caretakers monitor patient well-being.
Who You Are
You’re creative. You’re organized. You’re experienced. You’ve done this before. You want to do it again. We’re not looking for a superhero who thinks sheer hours = good work. Excess doesn’t impress us – creativity and efficiency do. You’ll have 8 hours a day to work, and, we hope, at least 8 hours a night to sleep.
You are a passionate software engineer with a deep understanding of what makes live, highly scalable platforms. You care deeply about bringing your unique engineering mind into creating a considerate and sustainable team and product.
You are autonomous - a manager of one. You enjoy working alone, you can make your own decisions and you will take full ownership of your work, assuming the responsibility for every detail, every step of the way.
You are a solid writer. You document your every decision so you don't just save the day, but make the lives of your future teammates easier.
Qualifications
Minimum Qualifications
BA/BS degree in Computer Science or related technical field or equivalent practical experience.
4 years of work experience or equivalent production-level experience with developing Machine Learning pipelines.

Experience with PyTorch, or at least another major deep learning framework such as TensorFlow, MXNet.
Preferred Qualifications
MS or PhD degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or related technical field.
Benefits
We work remotely and asynchronously, and that is why we are looking for a manager of one. But you will need to overlap for a few hours with San Francisco time in your normal work-day routine - this may mean a few hours of meetings in the evening depending on your time zone - we do our best to keep them short. We can provide you with space outside of your home to work if you need to (e.g. co-working offices), or help get your home to be more accommodating to work.
We do not trap people in front of their screens or lock them in overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours and ample vacation time. See our employee handbook here.
How To Apply
We want to get a sense of how you think and work. To that end, please be prepared to share with us your take on the following:
Tell us what you know about machine learning. How would you begin to approach figuring out where we stand with our technology, and where we should be standing?
Chart us an example of a machine learning pipeline that can support the needs of modern applications (related to detecting a person's activity)
What technologies inspired you recently? What machine learning technologies are you the most excited about?
We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Ouva is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.
We value great writers, so take your time with the application and put thought into your cover letter if you are writing one, but keep it fewer than 1500 words. Tell us why you want this job, not just any job.

Product Designer,Workstream,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted9 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=6fc93115b2fcf11c&fccid=030ecadfeed48cfa&vjs=3,"Workstream's SaaS technology addresses the top pain point of the local businesses around you: hiring, managing, and retaining qualified workers. Our customers include leading brands from multiple sectors, including McDonald's, Jamba Juice, 7-Eleven, Uber, FedEx, Chevron, etc. Workstream enables these businesses to hire faster with texting / SMS, cutting in half the time to engage, hire and onboard hourly workers. The 2.7 billion desk-less workers are 80% of the global workforce but have been heavily underserved by technology compared to the other 20% of in-office knowledge workers.

At series B, we are quickly expanding our product portfolio. We are a team from Google, Uber, MIT, and Stanford. In addition, we are backed by legendary VC's and industry's experts, including Founders Fund, BOND, Coatue, the CEO of Doordash, the President of Instacart, and more!
Check out this deck for more details about the role :)

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nEGXN3Vbyd3uTtzfyZuDMBAJRY3lCZ3NtX2houqPPmQ/edit#slide=id.gef1eb2d633_0_72

Day in The Life:

We are excited for our first US-based full-time product designer to join the team, to build the best hiring software for local businesses hiring hourly workers. Ideally, you are a self-starter, entrepreneurial, have a strong design sense, and move fast.

You are going to work simultaneously on some of the biggest problems (refactoring our product to focus more on roles such as Store Manager, Head of HR, and their use cases), as well as quick and dirty UI fixes. In the company's first 3 years, we've been scrappy, and we've learned a lot about our customers and their needs. We are excited to iteratively apply these learnings to streamline the product, so our non-tech-savvy users can have an easier experience navigating the product and getting to value.

We'd like you to own the solution-finding phase of the product development process. Our ideal flow would be for PM to identify a problem to solve  work with you (designer) to set priority  assuming it's a high priority, for you to wireframe a few ideas that afternoon  have a discussion the next morning with PM  iterate with PM / eng over the next 1-2 days  work towards a final prototype by the end of the week. Of course, this all hinges on you talking to users to maintain a solid foundation of user empathy and understanding.

We know that as with building a product, there's strengths and weaknesses to each designer. So here's what's most important to us. If your strengths resonate with this order, then let's talk!

[most important] UX design, transforming complexity to simplicity
Rapid prototyping, speed at execution; hacky and scrappy
User research, bias for talking to users to understand / empathize with them
Strong communication in an asynchronous team
UI design
Brand, website design
[least important] Illustrations

Logistically, ideally you are based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and would come into our office in SF SOMA 3 days a week (we have a parking lot!). Our product team currently consists of our 3 PMs, Rob (North Carolina) + Clif (Austin) + Ruming (SF), our designer Phil (Ukraine), and ~30 software engineers (China, Hong Kong, Singapore) – across 3 product squads.

As the first product design hire in the US, you will own design for one of our 3 products end-to-end, from ideation and research to pixel-perfect execution for new and existing products and features.
You will play a large role in restructuring our design systems and information architecture, in a way that is more oriented around end-user roles, so we can build more tailored experiences based on each use case.
You will work directly with our founding designer, PMs, and engineering leads to build and ship the very best experiences that delight our users
You will apply the full breadth of your design skill set through user research, UX design, and UI design
You will be responsible for our design vision, strategy and initiatives for an experience that exceeds our customers' expectations
You will act as a design and UX advocate for our employees, advising on design best practices and solutions

Who You Are:

B.A/B.S. in Graphic Design, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Science, or a related field/equivalent experience
5+ years experience or equivalent experience designing digital products, with a preference for SaaS / B2B applications
Experience in working and collaborating with diverse teams in a dynamic, rapid growth environment — comfortable negotiating tradeoffs with product and engineering partners
Experience in creating beautiful, high-fidelity mockups of your designs using Sketch, Figma or other modern design tools ready to be handed off to engineering
Thoughtful communication skills and the ability to present design decisions and processes openly, clearly, and confidently
An outstanding portfolio showcasing a foundation in solving business problems and design fundamentals
Ideally, you have built a product or have been part of a product team that went from 0 to 1.
You are tenacious, and won't let a problem stand until you've figured out how to solve it.
You are quick. Think on the order of minutes and hours, instead of days and weeks. We don't have time to waste.
Ability to act independently with a high degree of accuracy and reliability

How to be successful in this role

Our customers love Workstream (check out this screenshot of 1 of 60+ pages in our ""wall of love"" testimonial: https://tinyurl.com/y2nkxloa). We help them solve their biggest pain point, which is people and hiring.

At Workstream, we move fast. We are humble and hungry. And we work as a team. Check out our company values, which we use to make our decisions!

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHaeKG3IUy_1kE0y8FRnM8PPoEdMS0gmNIsSP3dG-3A/edit

You will get to see your design come to life within days, instead of weeks/months of designing them. And you will be successful when you move fast, but deliberately so, as well. You will be successful when you talk to users in length upfront, so you have full context of the environment our customers work in and can speak their language.

We are looking for someone who has high EQ and high IQ, sets the bar high and expects greatness from themselves and those they work with, and has a bias for action (we are a startup!). We've been scaling fast and we are looking for someone who is excited about owning a function that is continuously shifting. Come run with us!
What We Offer:

An opportunity to be an early employee at a high-growth SaaS company and work directly with the founding team
Full-time employees are offered comprehensive medical and dental benefits
A globally-distributed team who deeply cares about each other and shares ideas
A belief that productivity is measured by output
Flexible schedule with a ""use it how you need it"" vacation policy - we don't believe in capping or earning hours. We trust our team to get the job done and rest/recharge as they see fit

Our unique approach helps seniors feel truly seen and heard and focuses on only doing what's best for their individual circumstances. Not only are we providing extraordinary clinical care and redefining the patient experience, but we're also lowering costs for everyone involved. We've gone beyond traditional medicine by designing our business in a way that encourages us to care about the value we provide patients, not the number of visits we rack up. What does this mean exactly? We only make money when patients are healthy — period. This is the right way to practice medicine and we're bringing it to fruition.

We've started by building a multidisciplinary team of care navigators, doctors, nurses, and physician assistants who work right in senior living communities to provide residents better, more personalized and convenient care. With a headquarters office in Oakland, CA, the rest of our company works diligently to build and implement systems, tools, and programs in support of patient care.

Our value-based offering has led to over 30 communities partnering with us in the last year and us achieving 10X patient growth. We're a fast-growing company that's backed by lead investors including First Round Capital, Google's AI fund, Canvas Ventures, Foundation Capital, Y Combinator, and Susa. If you share in our vision of helping every senior, no matter their health status, being able to lead a life they find meaningful and worthwhile, join us!

Other benefits include:
Stock option plan
Paid parental leave
Health, vision, and dental insurance
401K retirement plan
Mileage and cell phone reimbursement
Some travel is required for this role. You must have the ability to drive between partner facilities regularly.

Pine Park Health provides the highest safety and quality of care for patients who can be at high-risk of COVID-19. To support this work, we require vaccination for all employees and proof of vaccination (at least first dose with plans to complete second dose) before hiring.

Pine Park Health is an equal opportunity employer — we aim to recruit, hire, develop, compensate, and promote regardless of of race, religion, country of origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability."

Cash App is the fastest growing financial brand in the world. Built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic money app with over 36 million active monthly users.
Loved by customers and by pop culture, we’ve held the #1 spot in finance on the App Store for almost two years, and our social media posts see more engagement in a day than most financial brands see in a year.
With major offices in San Francisco, New York, St. Louis, Portland, Kitchener-Waterloo, Toronto and Melbourne, Cash App is bringing a better way to send, spend, and save to anyone who has ever sought an alternative to today’s banking system.

Job Description
Machine Learning at Cash App has swiftly grown to become a central function of the business, with over 100 people working on solving some of the most cutting edge ML questions in FinTech. Our team is continuing to grow and we’re looking for Engineers with experience developing ML pipelines and infrastructure to join us and build out the next generation platform to power use cases across the company. Across the team, we employ methods ranging from simple heuristics to Deep Learning technology to improve our performance and services. We’re also excited to explore new directions with the team to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
Our ML Engineers operate embedded in product-focused Workstreams and work in close collaboration with Data Scientists, ML Modelers and Software Engineers from across Cash App. Here are some Workstreams that are currently growing:
Identity
The ML Identity team focuses on providing AI-based opportunities to establish and verify Cash App's customer identities across the services we provide. This team works to build out both security and accessibility for Cash App users. We're a small team of engineers focused on exploring AI longshots, balancing a passion for advancing what's possible with a commitment to positive real-world impact. The ML Identity engineering team is led by Kyle (who you'll report to) and this is a chance to work with us as a founding member.
Risk
The Risk team applies ML to protect our customers and our company’s bottom line from an ever changing landscape of fraud and platform abuse. We are continually refining and searching for new ways to leverage ML to stay ahead of ever more sophisticated fraud and scam patterns. In addition, we are continually evolving our platform to scale up in line with Cash App’s global expansion, and to provide the rapid payments platform that our customers expect and demand.
Banking
The Banking ML team focuses on all things ML related to the Cash Card and Banking at Cash. There is an element of risk and fraud prevention involved. From building pipelines and models to combat fraud on every Cash Card transaction and activation, to building out data models and pipelines to enable a large expansion of Cash Check Deposits. We are a new team that was created to support the fast growing banking space within Cash App. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that our customers experience safe and reliable Banking with Cash App.
Customer Support
The Cash Customer Support ML team has a vision to provide customer support that’s better than humans through ML. We’re a mixed team of engineers and modellers that work together to deliver models that help us support our customers when they run into problems. We currently use ML automation on two support channels: email and in-app chat. We’re actively working towards making these perform better and we’re always looking for innovative solutions to help our customers with ML.
Problems you’d work on:
Design elegant ML pipelines and services as well as prototype new approaches and productionize solutions at scale for our 36+ million active users
Create a world class platform for training, hosting and maintaining ML models
Apply ML and engineering best practices to shape how Cash App develops, tests and maintains ML-platform solutions
Help design and execute our long-term Machine Learning strategy across Cash App

Qualifications

A degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related technical field. A graduate degree is a nice to have
3+ years of experience in software development and demonstrated technical initiative and leadership on previous projects
Curiosity and a passion for Cash App's mission of economic empowerment
Experience helping your teammates grow through mentorship and providing constructive feedback
A desire to be hands-on and help invent the future of AI
The ability to work autonomously in the rapidly evolving world of ML
Experience or knowledge in ML is helpful but not a prerequisite: if you are a solid software engineer, then we are happy to train you up in the mysterious ways of ML
Stack:
We value general engineering skill and versatility over existing domain knowledge, but here’s a sample of what we currently use:
Python, Java and Kotlin
Tensorflow and PyTorch
AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes
MySQL, DynamoDB, Kafka, Apache Beam and Google DataFlow

Chief Data and Learning Officer,UpTogether,"Oakland, CA 94612•Remote",None,"$165,000 - $185,000 a year",Posted24 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=43407ab06c3b836b&fccid=d53324caf3a824f6&vjs=3,"Chief Data and Learning Officer (Full-time, Remote)
About Us

UpTogether is a national organization of individuals across the country with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities who share a passion for social justice and racial equity. Our mission is to recognize, highlight and invest in the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of people in historically undervalued communities and partner with government and philanthropy to do the same.
After working with thousands of families since our founding in 2001, at UpTogether, we are certain people don’t live in poverty because they are lazy, uneducated, or mismanage money, as stereotypes would indicate. Instead, the poverty cycle, which disproportionately impacts Black and Latinx communities, can be traced to well-intentioned but inadequate governmental and charitable policies and practices that rely on a traditional top-down approach.
UpTogether’s Strengths Based Approach (SBA) includes:

Community: We center our work around the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Capital: We invest in our members with unrestricted cash in recognition of the initiatives they are taking to improve their lives.
Choice: We trust that people in undervalued communities know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.

UpTogether reveals and accelerates the initiative people are taking to improve their lives.

As a community, a movement, and a platform, we use the power of information—compelling insights and personal success stories—to transform stereotypes, beliefs, practices, and policies. Together with our members, we are championing a community-led movement to boost economic and social mobility in communities that have been undervalued and underinvested in for far too long.
At UpTogether, we work toward these values:

Community: We honor the strengths and initiatives of people living in undervalued communities and promote the role social networks within these communities play in helping people accomplish their goals and achieve long-term socioeconomic mobility.
Impact: We test and scale strategies for systems adoption of a strength-based approach to accelerate socioeconomic mobility for people living at or below the poverty line in the U.S.
Collaboration: We center the lived experiences of families in undervalued communities and engage the knowledge, experience, and perspectives of our board, partners, and staff to build and grow a strength-based approach to end poverty.
Racial Equity: We are committed to being an anti-racist organization, and we promote anti-racist policies that eliminate the racial wealth divide.
Leadership: We acknowledge that leadership is not based on a title and honor the many forms in which it appears. We celebrate leadership that embodies all of our organizational values, driving us to act against the dominating deficit-based approach to fighting poverty.
Choice: We trust that people living at or below the poverty line know what’s best and are capable of making decisions for themselves and their families.

We’re backed by some of Silicon Valley’s leading investors including Softbank, CRV, Initialized, EQT, Draper Associates and YCombinator. We just announced our Series C in February 2021!

We're building a soft real-time machine learning system that provides shoppers with a seamless checkout experience.

We’re looking for someone to help us build our production system that creates consistent statistical 3D world models for every store we deploy. This role blends challenging tasks with our multi-view camera system, graph optimization problems, and structure from motion.

Experience with scientific computing or laboratory automation
Prior academic publication record in computer vision or related field
Experience working in a collaborative and fast-paced Agile team environment
Passion for biology and a startup work environment!

Culture

If you are curious and excited about science and technology, enjoying working in a high autonomy, high accountability, and hands on environment, there's a good chance you'll be energized working at Methid. We have a strong goal-oriented and asynchronous culture, so cogent and pithy writers will flourish. We emphasize learning and transparency and look for people who can expand the product's capabilities as well as their own.

We offer health, dental, vision, commuter and retirement benefits. We also have a generous vacation and paid time off policy. Methid believes in sharing the upside of our success with our team members and we include equity in all of our compensation packages.

Thank you for your interest. We look forward to hearing from you!

Cash App is the fastest growing financial brand in the world. Built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic money app with over 36 million active monthly users.
Loved by customers and by pop culture, we’ve held the #1 spot in finance on the App Store for almost two years, and our social media posts see more engagement in a day than most financial brands see in a year.
With major offices in San Francisco, New York, St. Louis, Portland, Kitchener-Waterloo, Toronto and Melbourne, Cash App is bringing a better way to send, spend, and save to anyone who has ever sought an alternative to today’s banking system.

Job Description
Machine Learning at Cash App has swiftly grown to become a central function of the business, with over 100 people working on solving some of the most cutting edge ML questions in FinTech. Our team is continuing to grow and we’re looking for Engineers with experience developing ML pipelines and infrastructure to join us and build out the next generation platform to power use cases across the company. Across the team, we employ methods ranging from simple heuristics to Deep Learning technology to improve our performance and services. We’re also excited to explore new directions with the team to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
Our ML Engineers operate embedded in product-focused Workstreams and work in close collaboration with Data Scientists, ML Modelers and Software Engineers from across Cash App. Here are some Workstreams that are currently growing:
Identity
The ML Identity team focuses on providing AI-based opportunities to establish and verify Cash App's customer identities across the services we provide. This team works to build out both security and accessibility for Cash App users. We're a small team of engineers focused on exploring AI longshots, balancing a passion for advancing what's possible with a commitment to positive real-world impact. The ML Identity engineering team is led by Kyle (who you'll report to) and this is a chance to work with us as a founding member.
Risk
The Risk team applies ML to protect our customers and our company’s bottom line from an ever changing landscape of fraud and platform abuse. We are continually refining and searching for new ways to leverage ML to stay ahead of ever more sophisticated fraud and scam patterns. In addition, we are continually evolving our platform to scale up in line with Cash App’s global expansion, and to provide the rapid payments platform that our customers expect and demand.
Banking
The Banking ML team focuses on all things ML related to the Cash Card and Banking at Cash. There is an element of risk and fraud prevention involved. From building pipelines and models to combat fraud on every Cash Card transaction and activation, to building out data models and pipelines to enable a large expansion of Cash Check Deposits. We are a new team that was created to support the fast growing banking space within Cash App. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that our customers experience safe and reliable Banking with Cash App.
Customer Support
The Cash Customer Support ML team has a vision to provide customer support that’s better than humans through ML. We’re a mixed team of engineers and modellers that work together to deliver models that help us support our customers when they run into problems. We currently use ML automation on two support channels: email and in-app chat. We’re actively working towards making these perform better and we’re always looking for innovative solutions to help our customers with ML.
Problems you’d work on:
Design elegant ML pipelines and services as well as prototype new approaches and productionize solutions at scale for our 36+ million active users
Create a world class platform for training, hosting and maintaining ML models
Apply ML and engineering best practices to shape how Cash App develops, tests and maintains ML-platform solutions
Help design and execute our long-term Machine Learning strategy across Cash App

Qualifications
You have:
A degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related technical field. A graduate degree is a nice to have
3+ years of experience in software development and demonstrated technical initiative and leadership on previous projects
Curiosity and a passion for Cash App's mission of economic empowerment
Experience helping your teammates grow through mentorship and providing constructive feedback
A desire to be hands-on and help invent the future of AI
The ability to work autonomously in the rapidly evolving world of ML
Experience or knowledge in ML is helpful but not a prerequisite: if you are a solid software engineer, then we are happy to train you up in the mysterious ways of ML
Stack:
We value general engineering skill and versatility over existing domain knowledge, but here’s a sample of what we currently use:
Python, Java and Kotlin
Tensorflow and PyTorch
AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes
MySQL, DynamoDB, Kafka, Apache Beam and Google DataFlow

Spring is accelerating the discovery of therapies for aging and its related diseases. A tight integration of biology and machine learning is at our core, and we're building a rare team of scientists and computational folks working together to accelerate our innovative approach to modeling the biology of aging (in vitro and in vivo) and turning experimental data into therapeutic insight.

Impact

Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Key Responsibilities

Office management- Work directly with the Chief of Staff and Operations Manager to provide support and manage the organization and functionality of the office space

Travel Logistics- support flights, hotels, transportation, dining, etc. planning for both our remote employees as well as job candidates

Our team

We are building an interdisciplinary team. We don't expect you to have a background in machine learning, just as we don't expect our computer scientists to be expert biologists. We do expect our teams to work closely and learn together day in and day out.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.


A unique opportunity

We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, Susa, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

And at the same time, we're just getting started. You're joining a team that has the funding needed to be ambitious while still early enough to help define our culture, choices, and success. Our expectations of you — and of ourselves — are high.

About You

1+ years of preferably office management or EA experience in either tech or biotech
Ability to adapt quickly to last-minute needs in a diverse, fast-growing startup and execute tasks in a timely and out of the box manner
Excellent organizational, problem-solving, and follow-up skills, as well as the ability to effectively handle multiple priorities while working independently

Spring is accelerating the discovery of therapies for aging and its related diseases. A tight integration of biology and machine learning is at our core, and we're building a rare team of scientists and computational folks working together to accelerate our innovative approach to modeling the biology of aging (in vitro and in vivo) and turning experimental data into therapeutic insight.

Impact

Aging is the single greatest risk factor for the most detrimental diseases on Earth — cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, muscle wasting, and more — and drugs that slow the biological damage accumulated while aging have the potential to reduce the incidences of these diseases, possibly simultaneously. We believe that in the not-too-distant future, the discovery of therapies for aging will provide some of the most effective tools in history for reducing our burden of disease and extending our healthy lifespan.

Our mission is to dramatically accelerate the realization of that future. And we’re bringing a new set of machine learning tools to bear on this challenge.

Key Responsibilities

Office management- Work directly with the Chief of Staff and Operations Manager to provide support and manage the organization and functionality of the office space
Team Culture- support in the crafting of fun & engaging activities, events, off-sites experiences to ensure employees continue to feel connected
Back office support- support accounts payable, organization of contracts, billing, and compliance paperwork
Travel Logistics- support flights, hotels, transportation, dining, etc. planning for both our remote employees as well as job candidates

Our team

We are building an interdisciplinary team. We don't expect you to have a background in machine learning, just as we don't expect our computer scientists to be expert biologists. We do expect our teams to work closely and learn together day in and day out.

We value building a diverse, inclusive environment and welcome all applicants regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.


A unique opportunity

We have deep support from some of the best investors in the world: General Catalyst, First Round, Felicis, Laura Deming's Longevity Fund, Susa, pharma/biotech angels, and many more. Our advisors are world leaders in aging research, senior execs at pharma, and top tech entrepreneurs.

And at the same time, we're just getting started. You're joining a team that has the funding needed to be ambitious while still early enough to help define our culture, choices, and success. Our expectations of you — and of ourselves — are high.

About You

1+ years of preferably office management or EA experience in either tech or biotech
Ability to adapt quickly to last-minute needs in a diverse, fast-growing startup and execute tasks in a timely and out of the box manner
Excellent organizational, problem-solving, and follow-up skills, as well as the ability to effectively handle multiple priorities while working independently
Comfortable with working in ambiguity
Not afraid to “get your hands dirty”


Nice to Haves

Some general science background or science interest
Experience with Airtable, Asana, GSuite, Bill.com, Slack, and Notion

Benefits
