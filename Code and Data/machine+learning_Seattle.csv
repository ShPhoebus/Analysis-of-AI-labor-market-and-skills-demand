RStudio is seeking a candidate for a Software Engineer to join the Open Source group to work on Python model ops software.

The Open Source group develops and maintains open source packages for data science, including R packages like ggplot2, dplyr, tidymodels, shiny, sparklyr, and RMarkdown. Since many data science teams involve both R and Python users, we are exploring how we can best contribute to the Python ecosystem. The goals of the Open Source group are not only to provide a seamless end-to-end data science experience, but also to help users learn and flourish. This involves developing and disseminating documentation (at the function, package, and task level) and fostering a welcoming community. We value kindness, humility, openness, and resourcefulness in our work and interactions with the community and each other.

For this role, we are looking for an experienced developer who will create and maintain Python packages for model deployment, monitoring, retraining, and more. You will work broadly with the tidymodels team and collaborate with other teams at RStudio involved in model deployment and Python package development.

Thinking strategically about the Python ecosystem and how we can best serve the Python data science community with our open source tools.
Working with coworkers across RStudio teams to break down new feature development into a concrete plan, write code and tests, respond to code reviews, and communicate the features to the wider community.
Triaging issues, helping clearly identify user needs for new features, and closing issues that we don’t have the resources to fix.
Reproducing and diagnosing reported bugs, converting them to unit tests, and developing code to fix them.
Maintaining and developing documentation.
Creating a welcoming environment for open source contributors.

About you:

You share our commitment to building open source software that provides a seamless end-to-end data science experience and an ecosystem that helps users learn and flourish. You are an applied modeling practitioner eager to translate what you’ve learned building machine learning systems to creating and maintaining widely-used open source model ops tooling. You think holistically about the end-to-end model lifecycle, and you love to help others succeed. You are humble, pragmatic, deliberate, and you have a keen sense of empathy for your community and co-workers. You also are:

Professional Python developer with experience developing models and creating robust ML systems.
Nice to have: Have created and published one or more Python libraries, e.g. on PyPI.
R-curious. Should be interested in R and willing to learn what makes it special.
Nice to have: Existing experience with modeling or programming in R.
Collaborative. Should be able to collaborate with multiple teams to make sure all the pieces fit together, contributing to and listening to diverse perspectives.
Effective communicator. Should be able to work effectively in a remote setting, as well as engage in written communication with users and contributors on GitHub.
Attentive to detail. Should be able to maintain and develop accurate, helpful, and inclusive written materials.
Action oriented. Should be able to follow up on feedback and make decisions even where there is uncertainty.
Invested in learning. Should be interested in and able to learn new things both technical and community-oriented.
Stewardship. Should work to leave things better than you found them.

Job summary
At AWS AI, we want to make it easy for our customers to deploy machine learning models on any endpoint in the cloud or at the edge. Just as SageMaker provides a complete set of services to simplify the task of building and training a model, Neo provides an inference engine that is designed to run any machine learning model on any hardware.

Neo optimizes machine learning models to perform at up to twice the speed of the original framework with no loss in accuracy. Upload a pre-trained model built with MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or XGBoost to your S3 bucket, choose your target hardware platform from Intel, NVIDIA, or ARM, and with a single API call, SageMaker Neo optimizes the model, converts it into an executable module, and returns it to your S3 bucket. The free open source Neo runtime uses less than 100th of the space of the framework to run the model on the target hardware.

Amazon SageMaker Edge Manager provides a software agent that runs on edge devices for model inference and a separate cloud service for managing models on edge devices.

This role focuses on the cloud services for both of these two strategic AWS AI SageMaker services. Developers will have the opportunity to work on both areas.

The SageMaker Neo and Edge Manager team is growing rapidly to keep up with growth in customers and their requests. We are hiring well-rounded software developers with backgrounds in machine learning, systems, AI accelerators, and embedded systems.
Join us to help AWS customers deploy machine learning models in the cloud and on edge devices at scale in production. Work on an open source industry-standard compiler and runtime for machine learning that is already deployed on over 20 million devices. You will have a passion for operational excellence, scale, and performance.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.

TTD – Lead Software Engineer
ABOUT THE ROLE:
Senior Lead Software Engineers serve both as technical individual contributors and people managers. You will be optimizing your own code, as well as making sure that your reports are able to optimize theirs.
You are an end-to-end owner. You will participate actively in all aspects of product strategy – from designing, building, and delivering products for our clients.
We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to lead engineers that focus on building large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.
Senior Lead Software Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and direct management of distributed teams, you will make others better and raise the bar for those around you.
WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
You have a sustained track record of leading engineers with a wide range of experience, while also making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you & your team are doing.
You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution.
You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You're a broadly skilled engineer who's interested in helping us build and scale distributed, multi-region systems.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
WHAT WE CARE ABOUT:

What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly, efficiently manage your project goals, contribute to product strategy, and help develop your team as they solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.
Does this sound like you? If so, we welcome your application and the chance to meet you.

Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.
Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?
Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.
About the Role :
Our Senior & Staff Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering products for our clients.
We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.
Senior Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
Who We Are Looking For:
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled engineer , accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
What We Care About:
What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.
Does this sound like you? If so, we welcome your application and the chance to meet you.

AWS CloudFormation provides an easy declarative way to create, deploy and manage applications and infrastructure in the AWS cloud. The CloudFormation teams are pioneers in the “Infrastructure as Code” space. We develop distributed systems that spin up infrastructure across AWS at unprecedented scale. This would have an impact in shaping our resource framework that allows CloudFormation to provision hundreds of AWS services. We are looking for System Development Engineers to join our amazing team, who excel in a fast-paced and often ambiguous environment where we love pushing the boundaries to innovate, learn while we design and develop new software.

You’ll get to learn, grow and work with an amazing team to:

Design/develop/iterate on developer tools and services that are used by thousands of AWS users.
Work with and learn many different technologies every day including Java, REST, Go, Python etc..,
Interface closely with internal and external customers to quickly drive new products and new features.

As a key engineer on the team, you will help build CloudFormation services and tools, automation supporting AWS global expansion, as well as deliver new AWS regions. You will collaborate with Product Teams to design solutions that make efficient use of resources and technologies. You will work with all stakeholders to develop schedules that ensure timely launch of new regions.

AWS has the most services and more features within those services, than any other cloud provider–from infrastructure technologies like compute, storage, and databases–to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and Internet of Things. Whether its Identity features such as access management and sign on, cryptography, console, builder & developer tools, and even projects like automating all of our contractual billing systems, AWS Platform is always innovating with the customer in mind. The AWS Platform team sustains over 750 million transactions per second.

Work/Life Balance
The CloudFormation team values work-life balance. Most days, our entire team is co-located in the Seattle office, but we’re also flexible when people occasionally need to work from home.

We are builder-operators of our services at AWS and have an on-call rotation where you’ll participate once every 5-6 weeks. We work together to reduce our on-call load by ensuring that our systems are fault tolerant, and resolve the root cause of an issue so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new team members. Our team is a mix of experience levels and Amazon tenures. We set an environment that encourages knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior engineers truly enjoy mentoring more junior engineers and engineers from non-traditional backgrounds through one-on-one mentoring and thorough but kind code reviews. We care and try to assign projects and tasks based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks, problems to solve in future.

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences.

Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren’t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online.

Job summary
Note: This position requires that the candidate selected be a US Citizen and must currently possess and maintain an active TS/SCI security clearance.

Do you want to help the U.S. Intelligence Community agencies implement innovative cloud computing solutions and solve technical problems? Would you like to do this using the latest cloud computing technologies? This is an excellent opportunity to join Amazon's world class technical team in Seattle, WA (Relocation is provided). You'd work with some of the best and brightest engineers in the industry, while also developing your skills and furthering your career within one of the most innovative and progressive technology companies anywhere. Our Serverless team is hiring experienced engineers to manage systems behind the US Intelligence Community's cloud services!

Serverless is one of the fastest growing teams within AWS and we are looking for technical leaders who share our passion to change the way the world computes. AWS provides a set of fully managed services, such as Lambda, API Gateway, and Messaging services, that you can use to build and run serverless applications.

Our customers are able to build scalable, fault-tolerant production systems without thinking about the needed infrastructure, capacity management, or large scaling events. Many of the hard problems of distributed systems are abstracted away by our serverless services, so that our customers can focus on solving their business problems.

The Serverless team is growing rapidly and we are looking for talented engineers who can help us create the massive scale and powerful new programming paradigms that our customers need to be successful. What does it take to succeed in this role? A successful Engineer will do much more than manage infrastructure and tools. You will:

Monitor the health of the fleet, automating system health, maintenance tasks, and reporting systems as needed
Perform various system maintenance tasks, including configuration of new machines
Maintain fleet inventory management, including producing, maintaining, and evolving capacity plans for various components
Further existing application and system management tools and processes that reduce manual efforts and increase overall efficiency
Dive deep and lead as a subject matter expert for operations of AWS Serverless Services

A day in the life
A Support Engineer supporting the AWS Serverless services will often start their day by checking the health of the production systems, verifying that each one has the capacity needed to support the expected workloads and that there aren't any metrics exceeding established thresholds.

They will often then look through the deployment schedule for the day, verify that all automated deployments are in-flight and successfully completing.

Once that is complete, it's common to spend some time working on some additional tooling or ops automation needed to help reduce the number of manual tasks needed to support our services.

About the team
The Serverless Amazon Dedicated Cloud (ADC) Team is responsible for building and maintaining the AWS Serverless services like Lambda, API Gateway and Step Functions in our ADC regions. Our general approach is to automate manual tasks vs just complete them with an end goal of reducing our operational load month-over-month as we scale.


Familiar with scripting languages such as Bash, Python, C, C++, Java or Ruby
Strong customer focus, ownership, urgency and drive
Good working knowledge/experience on highly distributed virtual environment, networking, s/w build and deployment process.
Familiar with the challenges surrounding efficient operations and failure mode analysis in large complex distributed systems

Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences.

Position Type: Faculty Full-time (Non-Tenure Track)
Location: Seattle Campus
Categories: Khoury College of Computer Sciences

About Northeastern:

Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university and the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong learning. Our world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students, faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the confines of discipline, degree, and campus.

Our locations—in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London; Portland, Maine; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley; Toronto; Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university system. Through this network, we expand opportunities for flexible, student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused research.

Northeastern’s comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate programs— in a variety of on-campus and online formats—lead to degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and careers.

About the Opportunity:

The Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University invites applications for one or more positions at the rank of Assistant Teaching Professor/Associate Teaching Professor/Full Teaching Professor in the Professional Masters Programs and in the Align Program at Northeastern’s Seattle campus for AY2022-2023.

Responsibilities:

We are seeking highly-motivated individuals committed to excellence in teaching. Full-time appointments at all ranks are renewable, career-focused non-tenure-track positions with responsibilities in teaching and service. Opportunities for research and scholarship are possible with course releases to make time for scholarship. Primary responsibilities include teaching graduate courses at the MS-level and in the Align Program (see below for a description). We are searching across all areas of computer and data science. Classes primarily meet in the evening and are small, with 10-40 students in a section. Faculty are supported with TAs and graders. Successful candidates will create course content and materials, and collaborate closely with colleagues across all Northeastern University campuses. Student advising and service to the college and university are an integral component of the position. Northeastern University is a global university recognized by our renowned co-op program and our focus on experiential learning.

The ALIGN bridges are designed for students from a variety of undergraduate backgrounds who need supplemental technical courses in order to matriculate into the Master of Science programs. ALIGN consists of four courses emphasizing the foundational knowledge and technical skills required for success in the respective Master of Science programs.

The Challenge

Women represent more than 50% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but only 18% of CS graduates. Similarly, underrepresented minorities represent 25% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but just 10% of CS graduates. By closing these gaps, we will not only address a major economic issue, but also a profound issue of social equity and inclusion.

Our Solution

The Align MS in CS program differs from typical MS in CS programs in several key ways. It is:
Designed for students who did not earn an undergraduate degree in CS
Coupled with Northeastern’s famous co-op program to provide a paid 6-8 month work experience in one of the college’s network of 500+ corporate partners
Taught at night year-round so students can keep up with other commitments and finish in 2.5 years
Offered locally at tech hubs across the country: Boston, Charlotte, San Francisco (opened in January 2019), Seattle, and Silicon Valley.

Our 5 year pilot to date has already demonstrated a graduation rate of 91%, with 100% employment and average salaries exceeding $100,000. Unlike code academies, our graduates are prepared for tech leadership career paths. Unlike undergraduate programs, the program takes only 2.5 years to complete. Most importantly, more than half of our graduates will be women and more than 25% will be underrepresented minorities. It is the ideal onramp for bringing a diversity of race, gender and thought to America’s tech workforce. Across all campuses we currently have 560 students in the Align MS in CS, with Seattle being the Align program’s original location. The Seattle campus is in the heart of South Lake Union, and in Computer Science we are growing rapidly, with currently 300 graduate students and projections to increase this significantly. Classes are held on campus in both day and evening timeslots, and we offer both the core Align program courses and a rich and growing collection of electives in software engineering, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Please learn more about the Align program at our website, https://align.khoury.northeastern.edu/

Qualifications:

A PhD in computer science or a related field is required by the appointment start date.

Salary Grade:

FAC

Additional Information:

Please submit a cover letter of interest highlighting teaching accomplishments and relevant professional expertise, a curriculum vitae, a teaching statement, and the names and contact information of at least three references.

Compensation is commensurate with qualifications and includes an outstanding benefits package.

You will learn to use the latest Lean and Agile thinking, create pragmatic solutions to solve mission-critical problems and challenge yourself every day.

Data Engineers develop modern data architecture approaches to meet key business objectives and provide end-to-end data solutions. You might spend a few weeks with a new client on a deep technical review or a complete organizational review, helping them to understand the potential that data brings to solve their most pressing problems. On other projects, you might be acting as the architect, leading the design of technical solutions, or perhaps overseeing a program inception to build a new product. It could also be a software delivery project where you're equally happy coding and tech-leading the team to implement the solution.

You’ll spend time on the following:

On other projects, you might be acting as the architect, leading the design of technical solutions, or perhaps overseeing a program inception to build a new product
Seamlessly incorporate data quality into your day-to-day work as well as into the delivery process

Here’s what we’re looking for:

You are equally happy coding and leading a team to implement a solution
You have a track record of innovation and expertise in Data Engineering
You’re passionate about craftsmanship and have applied your expertise across a range of industries and organizations
You have a deep understanding of data modelling and experience with data engineering tools and platforms such as Kafka, Spark, and Hadoop
You have built large-scale data pipelines and data-centric applications using any of the distributed storage platforms such as HDFS, S3, NoSQL databases (Hbase, Cassandra, etc.) and any of the distributed processing platforms like Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Oozie, and Airflow in a production setting
Hands on experience in MapR, Cloudera, Hortonworks and/or cloud (AWS EMR, Azure HDInsights, Qubole etc.) based Hadoop distributions
You are comfortable taking data-driven approaches and applying data security strategy to solve business problems
You’re genuinely excited about data infrastructure and operations with a familiarity working in cloud environments
Working with data excites you: you have created Big data architecture, you can build and operate data pipelines, and maintain data storage, all within distributed systems
Advocate your data engineering expertise to the broader tech community outside of Thoughtworks, speaking at conferences and acting as a mentor for more junior-level data engineers
Assure effective collaboration between Thoughtworks’ and the client’s teams, encouraging open communication and advocating for shared outcomes
A few important things to know:

Not quite ready to apply? Or maybe this isn’t the right role for you? That’s OK, you can stay in touch with AccessThoughtworks, our learning community

It is the policy of Thoughtworks, Inc. to provide a work environment free of discrimination.

What we do ...
At Tableau we help people see and understand data. With large deployments of Tableau, containing millions of visualizations, we need to provide people with tools to find the data that is important to them. No matter how good our product is at showing meaningful and beautiful visualizations, they cannot have an impact if they cannot be found.
Come join the growing search team within Tableau whose mission is to create a unified content discovery and search experience for both Tableau’s enterprise and consumer products. We do so by combining advanced search algorithms with machine learning to provide consistent and meaningful results appropriate to the users’ context and workflow to help them find relevant data and insights available within their organization to answer their business questions.
As the engineering manager for the Search Relevancy team, you will have the opportunity to spearhead this exciting initiative together with our product management and other engineering leaders in the search team to drive the early-stage thinking on search and discoverability. You would lead a small development team (4) of partially distributed engineers and partner with our research team. You would need to leverage their expertise in machine learning, advanced search algorithms, and enterprise software development to create a meaningful unified search experience in our products. In order to be successful in this role, you must be comfortable with ambiguity and working closely with other teams to tackle this problem together. You are not expected to be coding, but do need to have a strong input on architecture and be able to manage this complex initiative so we build a great solution. Equally if not more importantly, you will get to do all this while fostering an environment where people want to do their best work by supporting your team and helping grow each member in their careers. It’s an exciting mission and a great time to join this team.
Who you are…
· Leader: You lead the team in an authentic servant leadership style approach. You know how to enable and get stuff done through your team, but when the team is stuck you are capable of making difficult and timely decisions to lead the way.
· Mentor: You mentor, coach, guide, and correct the team to ensure that our devs are supported, unblocked, and empowered to achieve their full potential. You can find the right balance of achieving the needs of your team members and delivering on the business needs.
· Project Manager : You are a capable project manager with strong Agile practices, but also understand more traditional project management concepts to ensure maximum predictability, transparency, and accountability of deliverables. You are able to help with prioritization of bugs, feature work, architectural enhancements, and know how to effectively drive alignments across cross functional teams.
· Technical Leader: You have a strong technical background in large scale systems, with experience in On Prem and SaaS products and have expertise in rapid prototyping, digging through legacy code, modern architectural design patterns, mixed (SaaS/On Prem) deployments, scaling and security concerns, and most importantly, the search problem. You have solid architectural and engineering excellence skills through years of development experience on a development team, where you grew to be at least a senior or staff level engineer. You are familiar with Java/Python ideally have some real world experience with ML and Search. You understand and advocate for modern architecture patterns and engineering practices. Bonus: experience with AWS and past experience building search applications with Solr or ElasticSearch. You have a Bachelors degree in CS or equivalent work experience.
· Product Partner: You work as a team with your product partner and partner teams and have a strong customer focus and product / business acumen. You are passionate about building the right thing, in the right way and can motivate the team to do the same.
· You are a Recruiter! Tableau hires company builders and, in this role, you will be asked to be on the constant lookout for the best talent to bring onboard to help us continue to build one of the best companies in the world!

Cures Start Here. At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here.
At Fred Hutch, we believe that the innovation, collaboration, and rigor that result from diversity and inclusion are critical to our mission of eliminating cancer and related diseases. We seek employees who bring different and innovative ways of seeing the world and solving problems. Fred Hutch is in pursuit of becoming an antiracist organization. We are committed to ensuring that all candidates hired share our commitment to diversity, antiracism, and inclusion.

The Geraghty Lab seeks an exceptionally skilled, experienced molecular biologist to join their team. A summary of Dr. Geraghty's research can be found here.
Responsibilities:

The Staff Scientist will work in a research laboratory that performs state of the art genotyping for disease association studies. The laboratory collaborates with local and international labs to carry out anthropological, clinical, and basic disease studies that are aimed at a better understanding and development of data and tools for diagnosis and treatment of a variety of human diseases.
A core goal is to facilitate the use of immune genetic data both as a predictive tool in anticipating clinical outcomes (diagnosis) and as knowledge and information relevant to the biological processes causal of those outcomes (therapeutics.) Precisely such application has long been active in support of hematopoietic cell transplants (HCTs) and plans are to expand and extend use to infectious disease, autoimmunity, and cancer. This work includes two fronts in expanding the genetic testing capacities of our genotyping systems and developing new analytic capabilities for data application. Novel typing systems focusing on heretofore untested immune response variation are being developed by building on the core systems supporting HLA. For novel analytics, study cohorts have been assembled to apply machine learning/artificial intelligence tools to identify patterns of immune genetic variation predictive of clinical outcomes in HCTs (for replication with and extension with new methods and added data) and for COVID-19 as a model of infectious disease.
Qualifications:

A PhD in a biological science or related with an understanding of the fundamentals of molecular genetics is required. Familiarity with the genetics of the immune response would be a significant advantage – in particular with the HLA system. To be successful in this position, one must have the ability to communicate effectively with coworkers, working together in executing tasks that engage multiple complementary activities in parallel. In addition to benchwork, these activities include data analysis and effective interaction with the laboratory’s software and data analysis group. The ability and willingness to take initiative in problem solving and suggestions for workflow improvements will be a key to advancement and associated benefits.
Fred Hutch has a mandatory COVID-19 vaccine requirement, with exceptions only for approved medical or religious accommodations.

As a condition of employment, newly hired employees must provide proof of vaccination or initiate the accommodations process before their first day of employment.
A statement describing your commitment and contributions toward greater diversity, equity, inclusion, and anti-racism in your career or that will be made through your work at Fred Hutch is requested of all finalists.
Our Commitment to Diversity: We are proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA) Employer. We are committed to cultivating a workplace in which diverse perspectives and experiences are welcomed and respected. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, ancestry, national origin, sex, age, disability (physical or mental), marital or veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, political ideology, or membership in any other legally protected class.

"Senior Staff Software Engineer, Onboarding/Training/Tooling",Outreach,"Seattle, WA+2 locations",4.0,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=7dcadb8f365d0f27&fccid=124e422da333293e&vjs=3,"Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
About the Team/Role
The Dev Tooling team is an internal-facing team dedicated to enabling the entire engineering organization to do better work. This wide and intentionally-vague charter encompasses a slew of evolving topics. If there’s a common thread between multiple projects, whether discovered in the present or envisaged for the future, we try to get out ahead and build the systems, tooling, and training needed for that work to be successful. We’re also spearheading a long-term project of open-sourcing our entire service platform - from kubernetes cluster-building to template-based service development to the development environment/tooling to test it, it’s all going to be one big startup-in-a-box system for the world to use.
In the past, our team has built onboarding documentation, tooling to automatically set up dev machines, and a multi-day exercise that is a tour-de-force of our full technology stack for all engineers to run as they onboard. We also have been coordinating periodic training sessions with third parties in applicable technologies to our organization: Golang, Kubernetes, React, and more.
We are looking for a dedicated squad member to expand on many of these currently-primordial areas:
We’ve had the most success with training programs when we carefully work with the vendor to tune the content to our company’s exact tooling — we want to double down on this approach and really evolve an ongoing set of classes for our engineers to take, with both introductory and advanced topics.
We have rudimentary engineering architecture presentations we run once a month. We’d like to evolve this into in-house training programs around some of our more bespoke technology stacks — our deployment structure/partitioning system, our service map, our observability system, how we use kubernetes, the services provided in our clusters, graphql, and more.
Our onboarding exercise is a great start, but we want to expand it out much further — add telemetry exercises, data pipeline work, experimentation, light database tuning, and more. Just like an introductory course at college, we want everyone to at least dabble widely in what we do here in their first weeks, so they know what tooling exists across the board. And this program will continually evolve as our company does.
Designing modules for an upcoming self-service learning system for everything from security topics through to tech knowledge expansion
Help organize our existing twice-a-year org-wide hackathons and provide more structure/planning around the lead-up, team organization, judging, etc.
Taking feedback from the rest of the org back to the dev tooling team to continuously improve everything we do.
Basic Requirements
You love enabling your coworkers to be successful
You thrive in an ambiguous environment that requires seeking out and collaborating with both your team and the rest of the company to design effective solutions
Able to write high quality code in a programming language (e.g. Golang, Ruby, Scala, Elixir, Python) that deploys to a production environment used by customers
Experience designing and supporting internal-facing tooling where the “customers” are your coworkers
Understanding of which details are important and ability to prioritize incremental delivery over long-term go-dark projects
Experience with container-based workflows and services (Kubernetes preferred but not required)
Familiar with continuous deployment environments
Willingness to learn new technologies (most of our time is spent in Golang, with a smattering of Ruby/Rails, Typescript, and Elixir)
You embody our core values. We are hungry craftspeople, we have grit, we are honest, we take ownership, we have each other’s back no matter what, we’re one with our customers, and we find strength in diversity and inclusion

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Job summary
Are you looking to join a team that is among the fastest growing organizations at Amazon? Does wearing multiple hats and working in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment sound like a good fit? Then consider joining the FBA team.

Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a dynamic and growing multi-billion dollar business that enables Sellers to leverage all of the physical capabilities of Amazon - transportation, storage, pick & pack, and customer service. From the Seller’s point of view, FBA provides a way to take advantage of Amazon’s scale to build and grow their ecommerce business. Basically, send your stuff to us and we’ll sell and ship for you (plus take care customer service) with the same high level of standards that Amazon customers expect.

We are continuously building and inventing systems that enable Sellers to grow their business faster. From a technology point of view, FBA creates many challenges of scale and complexity that result from being the intersection between software and the physical world. Our large distributed systems are composed of several dozen different services. For example, we own systems that enable Sellers to create inbound shipments, integrate with carriers like UPS to provide shipping discounts, perform complex optimizations to determine inventory placement, and use predictive techniques like Machine Learning to estimate when a shipment will arrive. In addition to backend systems, FBA also owns a diverse set of Seller-facing Web UIs that are continually enhanced, including new Mobile versions. To support our level of scale and rate of growth, we need an experienced and passionate Quality Assurance Engineer who will relentlessly drive to improve both the quality of our systems and the Seller experience they provide.

As a QA Engineer you will architect, design and build test plans and automation to push our seller systems to their limits and beyond. What you build will have huge impact on millions of Amazon customers.

Key job responsibilities

Create test plans, strategy, test cases and automation to enable both UI, integration and back end testing.
Work with Engineers/product owners to understand complex customer usage models and develop test plans that approximate real-world environments.
Drive software development process toward quality-centric methodologies and implement tools/dashboards for automated reporting on quality metrics
Work closely with the technical leaders to develop the best technical design and approach for testing our functionality at scale.
Build software solutions where the problem is not well defined. You are capable of understanding the interaction between the components in a distributed system in order to ensure they are functioning properly
Experience with browser test automation using Selenium/Webdriver
Knowledge of industry standard test automation tools
Experience with open source tools and resources
Excellent communication, analytical and problem solving skills
Experience with performance, scalability, and reliability testing methodologies of complex distributed systems.

We are a global wellness technology company inspiring millions of people to adopt healthy habits for real life. We do this through engaging digital experiences, face-to-face workshops and sustainable programs that encourage people to move more, shift their mindset and eat healthier while enjoying the foods they love. By drawing on over five decades of experience and expertise in behavioral science, we build communities in order to deliver wellness for all.
Role Overview:
WW is seeking an analyst to find interesting things in data that can tell a great story. Our data includes anonymized health-related tracking from over 5 million subscribers around the world. The analyst who fills this role will dig into our data on weight loss, physical activity, sleep, and mindset, and figure out anything that anyone would find interesting. No kidding. If you’re curious about how people establish healthy habits, this role is a chance for you to be professionally curious and get answers to your questions. The answers you find will then be used by the public relations team to pitch media and get the word out about how WW supports our members .
This role collaborates with Public Relations to help everyone learn about what WW offers and to help further solidify that WW is the leader in weight loss and wellness. Recent questions we have included, “Can we see what people are eating now that they are socializing more coming out of the pandemic?”, and “Are changes in eating patterns making it harder for members to lose weight?” If these kinds of questions are what you would like to dig into, this is a job for you.
The work includes brainstorming with Public Relations to think of interesting questions; data wrangling and a lot of SQL to find answers; and writing up findings to share results. The extent of the write-ups will vary depending on how Public Relations will use the information. Much of the research will be correlational, but WW runs a lot of experiments (A/B tests), and data on causation will be available for some questions. The role could include some machine learning to enhance the data (think fuzzy matching to find the right foods in a database).
Key Responsibilities:
Plan and run data analyses to discover and report interesting findings
Collaborate with PR team on choosing what questions to pursue
Requirements:
Required Experience & Skills
Great comfort in SQL
5+ years experience in data analytics
Great write up and reporting skills
Collaboration and presentation skills: show what is interesting and why it is interesting
Familiarity with research methods and statistical analysis
For example, understanding why correlation is not causation, and what statistical significance is
Preferred Experience & Skills
Public relations; press releases; journalism
Reporting and presenting to leadership
Cross-functional consulting, collaboration, and negotiation
Python
R
Machine learning
Bachelors/advanced degree in a related field
Snowflake
Business intelligence dashboarding
At WW, it is our priority to cultivate a diverse and inclusive workplace.

Youâ€™re a fantastic storyteller. You know that our products tell our customers a story through the user experience. You wonâ€™t rest until that story is a compelling one.
You love rules and you know when to break them. You think systemically because you know that creating a coherent experience requires it.

Lead Machine Learning Engineer,Amperity,"Seattle, WA+1 location",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=22a82c95c866e561&fccid=fbc6c0cd24c4be53&vjs=3,"Amperity is more than just a leading Customer Data Platform — it's a unique mix of people, technology, and opportunity. The people are whip-smart, deeply committed, and energizing. The technology is multi-patented, AI-powered, industry-shaping customer data management software that we invented because there was no way to solve the problems that we wanted to help consumer brands overcome. The opportunity is twofold: a market opportunity to provide a solution that consumer brands have been trying to find for decades, and a personal opportunity to grow and learn and hitch your career to a rocket ship.

Since our founding in 2016, Amperity has been growing 2.5X year-over-year. We've raised $187M in funding, including a recent Series D that increased our valuation to over one billion dollars. We're going places, fast, and we want you to come with us.

We help these brands make sense of massive amounts of transaction and engagement data so that they can finally know who their customers are, what opportunities exist, and how to provide the kinds of experiences that delight consumers and move the business metrics that matter. Our customers include Starbucks, Alaska Airlines, Patagonia, Kroger, J. Crew, Brooks Running, Planet Fitness, DICK's Sporting Goods, and many more.

We're building something that's never existed before, and we're doing it in a way that's great for consumers, transformational for our customers, and career-making for the members of the Amperity team. Come help us make it happen!
The Team

The data science team at Amperity is a close-knit community of engineers and data scientists that move quickly and rely on each other to think independently, work autonomously, handle ambiguity, and solve hard problems. We identify, design and implement algorithms that lie at the heart of our products:

Identity matching: deduplicating and clustering billions of records to their underlying identities daily. Our customers use our predictions to analyze their customer base and create a personalized experience for their customers at every touchpoint.
Predictive modeling: With unified and enriched customer profiles (thanks to our identity matching pipeline), we build advanced customer-centric models to predict metrics/behaviors such as customer lifetime value, product recommendations, discount sensitivity, and event propensity.

In addition to algorithmic development, we value sharing our findings with the broader data science community. We publish our research in top-tier peer-reviewed publications, engage with fellow data scientists by speaking at internal and external conferences, and also hold several patents focused on our core IP (with many more to come).

We're looking for a Lead Machine Learning Engineer to join our rapidly growing data science team and help lead us in developing state-of-the-art machine learning pipelines. As a tech lead, you'll implement best practices in ML operations and infrastructure engineering while mentoring others on the team to bring out their best. You'll also lead the build in productizing predictive models that help our customers understand their customers and execute a smarter, more informed business strategy.

What You'll Do
Work alongside data scientists to architect end to end ML pipelines that predict complex user behaviors and preferences
Manage and innovate our ML ops infrastructure that helps us ensure the stability and uptime of our predictive modelling suite
Develop and maintain our data science stack, including integrations with pyspark, databricks, MLFlow, and Amperity's own software application
Mentor and help manage an active (and fun) group of machine learning practitioners and data scientists distributed across New York and Seattle
Generate and implement novel ideas for IP in the form of patents, research papers, conference presentations
About You
Undergraduate degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g. computer science, mathematics) with 5+ years of ML software development experience
2+ years of hands-on experience implementing production machine learning systems at scale in Scala, Python, Java, R, or similar languages. Experience with tools like Spark MLlib, MLFlow, Scikit-learn, etc. is a strong plus
Strong background in a broad set of ML concepts ranging from regression to clustering, along with model prototyping, tuning, and evaluation
Extensive experience with distributed computation and specifically Apache Spark; comfortable with evaluating, optimizing, and debugging Spark applications
Domain expertise in probabilistic databases, customer base analyses, or forecasting a strong plus
Ability and desire to synthesize complex ideas for both technical and non-technical audiences. Good communication skills in conducting code reviews, writing technical documentation, and giving internal and external presentations.
Benefits

We offer all the benefits you'd expect from a great place to work: 100% employee healthcare coverage, transportation subsidies, a comfortable work environment with plenty of snacks, and other employee experience perks like events and activities, both in-person and remote. We also offer self-managed PTO and the flexibility to do your best work in the way that works for you. We provide an inclusive environment where you'll be challenged to find and unlock your full potential, surrounded by a team of world-class people driving for excellence.

Amperity is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status."

Don't be! We're building the first Operating System for Global Trade. That's why it's crucial for us to bring people from diverse backgrounds and experiences together with our industry veterans to help move the freight forwarding industry forward.
What's freight forwarding, and why does it matter? Freight forwarding is the coordination and shipment of goods from one place to another, and it's what makes global trade possible. Flexport is on a mission to make global trade easier for everyone because we believe it can help connect the world and break down economic barriers.
We know this industry is complex. That's why we invest in education starting day one with Flexport Academy, a one-week intensive onboarding program explicitly designed to set every new Flexport employee up for success.

At Flexport, our ability to fulfill our mission of making global trade easy for everyone relies on having a diverse, dedicated, and engaged workforce. That is why Flexport is committed to creating and nurturing an environment where anyone can be their authentic self. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, physical and mental disability, health status, marital and family status, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, military and veteran status, and any other characteristic protected by applicable law."

Bachelor’s degree in Customer Research, Statistics, or a related field of study, or commensurate professional experience

The Home Innovation Team (HIT) is on a mission to help customers navigate through the most complex and personal purchase decisions they can make – that of home furnishings and decor. We are looking for a UX Researcher to investigate existing experiences and inspire new ideas in areas like 3D visualization, style recommendations, and interior design to help us raise the bar on our experiences and our customer’s shopping journey. Consider this - have you ever shopped for furniture or decor? How many trips to the store or online sites it took to figure things out? How often did you know the exact words to describe what you were looking for? If you’ve ever experienced moments like these, you know how hard it is to find what you need or like and then decide if it fits your unique needs. Today’s home shopping experience often either requires spending a lot of time and energy to find just the right thing or settle for whatever is available, and then spending even more time to return the product if you discover at home that it does not work for you. We are building the technology and experiences to eliminate these problems and make shopping more enjoyable.

Partnering with a group of seasoned UX designers, researchers, product managers and engineers that are on the front-line of innovations like machine learning and 3D visualization, you’ll be a part of molding the future of retail shopping. Teams will look to you to help provide insights to inform them on how to meet the current and emerging needs of customers and create more informed and confident purchasing decisions. You’ll also be part of growing our research practice, as we scale our current methodologies and thinking to support other lifestyle purchases, such as Pet Parenting and Customizable products. As with every project within Amazon, we work backwards from our customer's needs and the challenges they have. Our team tackles some of the toughest problems in retail to:

Remove stress and ease decision making for complex and nuanced purchases like large furniture items
Inspire our customers with beautiful experiences and help them find relevant products.
Provide expert advice and information to help guide our customers in their decision making process.
Get customers to the products they want faster by improving the ways to search and browse in shopping.
Develop personalized experiences and intelligently help customers find useful products that match their preferences and styles.
Help customers learn, develop, and refine their personal style to improve and customize their shopping experience.

Key responsibilities will include:

Be part of growing the team’s research capabilities to measure customer experience across global, product, and interaction levels
Work with multi-disciplinary product teams to understand and define open questions, hypotheses, and success metrics to shape research
Define and execute research methods appropriate to the questions at hand, which can range across user testing, surveys, interviews, AB tests, and secondary research
Provide insights and thought leadership to product teams and the broader organization to inspire innovations and help guide teams on how to address top customer and business needs
Educate the organization on methods, insights, and opportunities revealed by your own work and that of others to increase shared understanding of research across the Home Innovation Team and Amazon
Bring new ideas and expertise to help continue raising the quality of research across the team

The ideal candidate for this position is customer-obsessed, detail-oriented, familiar working with technical teams and able to handle multiple projects at a time in a fast-paced environment. The most successful members of our team are also capable of working through a high degree of ambiguity, eager to learn, and thrive in a resource-constrained environment.


Excellent communications skills with evidence of conveying complex concepts clearly and persuasively to a variety of audiences
Experience researching and developing experiences for global markets
Demonstrated creativity for selecting the a mix of research methods to provide actionable insights and the capacity to invent new methods when the resources do not exist
Familiarity with survey creation and analysis
