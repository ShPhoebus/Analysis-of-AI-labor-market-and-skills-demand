Organization: Information School

Title: Postdoctoral Scholar - Computational Social Science

Position Details
Position Description

The University of Washington, Information School (UW iSchool) invites applications for a Postdoctoral Scholar to work with Dr. Tanu Mitra on an ONR-YIP funded project titled “Influencing Communities and Narratives: New Techniques for Understanding Adversarial Influence Online.”
In collaboration with Dr. Mitra and her students, the postdoctoral scholar will contribute primarily to the above project, along with any other projects they may be interested in exploring on the topic of adversarial online influence and misinformation.
The Postdoctoral Scholar will also have the opportunity to engage with researchers at the Center for an Informed Public (CIP). The CIP is a multidisciplinary institute with a core mission aiming to resist strategic misinformation, promote an informed society, and strengthen democratic discourse. The CIP offers an exceptional opportunity to work closely with the Center’s faculty, including sociologists, information scientists, computer scientists, and policy experts. Located in Seattle, the position also offers opportunities for engagement with scholars and industry leaders in the area.
The project aims to study how adversarial online influence looks like in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), particularly, in the Indian subcontinent through a series of large-scale quantitative analysis and experiments conducted on social media. Specific questions that the project will answer include: 1) What are the key vectors of adversarial influence operations in the IOR? How do mainstream media interact with new media (social media) and how do adversaries utilize this landscape to launch influence operations online in the IOR? 2) How do we characterize community-based and narrative-based influence in the region? 3) How can we interrogate and audit algorithms for adversarial influence in the IOR? This work will involve collecting and analyzing data from multiple social media platforms, constructing machine learning models, complementing quantitative analysis work with deep qualitative analysis, and developing and conducting audit experiments to measure influence in real-time online.
Applicants with expertise in quantitative (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing), qualitative (e.g., discourse analysis), computational social science, social computing, and HCI/CSCW are strongly encouraged to apply. The position can also provide an opportunity to learn new methodologies and approaches. We encourage applicants from backgrounds traditionally marginalized/underrepresented in the field to apply.
Position Duration: This is a two year position. The initial appointment is for a minimum of one year, with a strong possibility of reappointment in the 2nd year. This position will begin as early as January 1, 2022.
Postdoctoral Scholars are represented by UAW 4121 and are subject to the collective bargaining agreement, unless agreed exclusion criteria apply. For more information, please visit the University of Washington Labor Relations website.

Organization: Information School

Title: Postdoctoral Scholar - Computational Social Science

Position Details
Position Description

The University of Washington, Information School (UW iSchool) invites applications for a Postdoctoral Scholar to work with Dr. Tanu Mitra on an ONR-YIP funded project titled “Influencing Communities and Narratives: New Techniques for Understanding Adversarial Influence Online.”
In collaboration with Dr. Mitra and her students, the postdoctoral scholar will contribute primarily to the above project, along with any other projects they may be interested in exploring on the topic of adversarial online influence and misinformation.
The Postdoctoral Scholar will also have the opportunity to engage with researchers at the Center for an Informed Public (CIP). The CIP is a multidisciplinary institute with a core mission aiming to resist strategic misinformation, promote an informed society, and strengthen democratic discourse. The CIP offers an exceptional opportunity to work closely with the Center’s faculty, including sociologists, information scientists, computer scientists, and policy experts. Located in Seattle, the position also offers opportunities for engagement with scholars and industry leaders in the area.
The project aims to study how adversarial online influence looks like in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), particularly, in the Indian subcontinent through a series of large-scale quantitative analysis and experiments conducted on social media. Specific questions that the project will answer include: 1) What are the key vectors of adversarial influence operations in the IOR? How do mainstream media interact with new media (social media) and how do adversaries utilize this landscape to launch influence operations online in the IOR? 2) How do we characterize community-based and narrative-based influence in the region? 3) How can we interrogate and audit algorithms for adversarial influence in the IOR? This work will involve collecting and analyzing data from multiple social media platforms, constructing machine learning models, complementing quantitative analysis work with deep qualitative analysis, and developing and conducting audit experiments to measure influence in real-time online.
Applicants with expertise in quantitative (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing), qualitative (e.g., discourse analysis), computational social science, social computing, and HCI/CSCW are strongly encouraged to apply. The position can also provide an opportunity to learn new methodologies and approaches. We encourage applicants from backgrounds traditionally marginalized/underrepresented in the field to apply.
Position Duration: This is a two year position. The initial appointment is for a minimum of one year, with a strong possibility of reappointment in the 2nd year. This position will begin as early as January 1, 2022.
Postdoctoral Scholars are represented by UAW 4121 and are subject to the collective bargaining agreement, unless agreed exclusion criteria apply. For more information, please visit the University of Washington Labor Relations website.

Qualifications

Applicants must have a PhD in Information or Computer Science or a related field

Excellent written and verbal communication skills

An ability to work in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary environment, including demonstrated success in working with diverse populations

We will consider candidates who have accepted tenure-track positions at another institution but with the ability to defer their start date.

Instructions

A cover letter describing your interest in this position; and explicitly addressing past, present, and/or future (planned) contributions to equity, diversity, and inclusion.

A brief research statement that outlines your research achievements and goals and summarizes your qualifications for this position.

Curriculum vitae, including names and contact information of three references

Two published papers, or equivalent writing samples that demonstrate expertise and fit for the position

A link to a professional webpage, Google scholar page (if applicable), and github profile (if applicable).

Applications will be accepted until filled. Review of applications will begin immediately. Interested candidates should contact Tanu Mitra at tmitra@uw.edu.

Organization: Information School

Title: Postdoctoral Scholar - Computational Social Science

Position Details
Position Description

The University of Washington, Information School (UW iSchool) invites applications for a Postdoctoral Scholar to work with Dr. Tanu Mitra on an ONR-YIP funded project titled “Influencing Communities and Narratives: New Techniques for Understanding Adversarial Influence Online.”
In collaboration with Dr. Mitra and her students, the postdoctoral scholar will contribute primarily to the above project, along with any other projects they may be interested in exploring on the topic of adversarial online influence and misinformation.
The Postdoctoral Scholar will also have the opportunity to engage with researchers at the Center for an Informed Public (CIP). The CIP is a multidisciplinary institute with a core mission aiming to resist strategic misinformation, promote an informed society, and strengthen democratic discourse. The CIP offers an exceptional opportunity to work closely with the Center’s faculty, including sociologists, information scientists, computer scientists, and policy experts. Located in Seattle, the position also offers opportunities for engagement with scholars and industry leaders in the area.
The project aims to study how adversarial online influence looks like in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), particularly, in the Indian subcontinent through a series of large-scale quantitative analysis and experiments conducted on social media. Specific questions that the project will answer include: 1) What are the key vectors of adversarial influence operations in the IOR? How do mainstream media interact with new media (social media) and how do adversaries utilize this landscape to launch influence operations online in the IOR? 2) How do we characterize community-based and narrative-based influence in the region? 3) How can we interrogate and audit algorithms for adversarial influence in the IOR? This work will involve collecting and analyzing data from multiple social media platforms, constructing machine learning models, complementing quantitative analysis work with deep qualitative analysis, and developing and conducting audit experiments to measure influence in real-time online.
Applicants with expertise in quantitative (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing), qualitative (e.g., discourse analysis), computational social science, social computing, and HCI/CSCW are strongly encouraged to apply. The position can also provide an opportunity to learn new methodologies and approaches. We encourage applicants from backgrounds traditionally marginalized/underrepresented in the field to apply.
Position Duration: This is a two year position. The initial appointment is for a minimum of one year, with a strong possibility of reappointment in the 2nd year. This position will begin as early as January 1, 2022.
Postdoctoral Scholars are represented by UAW 4121 and are subject to the collective bargaining agreement, unless agreed exclusion criteria apply. For more information, please visit the University of Washington Labor Relations website.

Qualifications

Applicants must have a PhD in Information or Computer Science or a related field

Excellent written and verbal communication skills

Organization: Information School

Title: Postdoctoral Scholar - Computational Social Science

Position Details
Position Description

The University of Washington, Information School (UW iSchool) invites applications for a Postdoctoral Scholar to work with Dr. Tanu Mitra on an ONR-YIP funded project titled “Influencing Communities and Narratives: New Techniques for Understanding Adversarial Influence Online.”
In collaboration with Dr. Mitra and her students, the postdoctoral scholar will contribute primarily to the above project, along with any other projects they may be interested in exploring on the topic of adversarial online influence and misinformation.
The Postdoctoral Scholar will also have the opportunity to engage with researchers at the Center for an Informed Public (CIP). The CIP is a multidisciplinary institute with a core mission aiming to resist strategic misinformation, promote an informed society, and strengthen democratic discourse. The CIP offers an exceptional opportunity to work closely with the Center’s faculty, including sociologists, information scientists, computer scientists, and policy experts. Located in Seattle, the position also offers opportunities for engagement with scholars and industry leaders in the area.
The project aims to study how adversarial online influence looks like in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), particularly, in the Indian subcontinent through a series of large-scale quantitative analysis and experiments conducted on social media. Specific questions that the project will answer include: 1) What are the key vectors of adversarial influence operations in the IOR? How do mainstream media interact with new media (social media) and how do adversaries utilize this landscape to launch influence operations online in the IOR? 2) How do we characterize community-based and narrative-based influence in the region? 3) How can we interrogate and audit algorithms for adversarial influence in the IOR?

Postdoctoral Scholar - Computational Social Science,University of Washington,"Seattle, WA 98195 (University District area)",4.1,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=474e1a9fb706ad52&fccid=142783ac2edbe56b&vjs=3,"Position Overview

Organization: Information School

Title: Postdoctoral Scholar - Computational Social Science

Position Details
Position Description

The University of Washington, Information School (UW iSchool) invites applications for a Postdoctoral Scholar to work with Dr. Tanu Mitra on an ONR-YIP funded project titled “Influencing Communities and Narratives: New Techniques for Understanding Adversarial Influence Online.”
In collaboration with Dr. Mitra and her students, the postdoctoral scholar will contribute primarily to the above project, along with any other projects they may be interested in exploring on the topic of adversarial online influence and misinformation.
The Postdoctoral Scholar will also have the opportunity to engage with researchers at the Center for an Informed Public (CIP). The CIP is a multidisciplinary institute with a core mission aiming to resist strategic misinformation, promote an informed society, and strengthen democratic discourse. The CIP offers an exceptional opportunity to work closely with the Center’s faculty, including sociologists, information scientists, computer scientists, and policy experts. Located in Seattle, the position also offers opportunities for engagement with scholars and industry leaders in the area.
The project aims to study how adversarial online influence looks like in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), particularly, in the Indian subcontinent through a series of large-scale quantitative analysis and experiments conducted on social media. Specific questions that the project will answer include: 1) What are the key vectors of adversarial influence operations in the IOR? How do mainstream media interact with new media (social media) and how do adversaries utilize this landscape to launch influence operations online in the IOR? 2) How do we characterize community-based and narrative-based influence in the region? 3) How can we interrogate and audit algorithms for adversarial influence in the IOR? This work will involve collecting and analyzing data from multiple social media platforms, constructing machine learning models, complementing quantitative analysis work with deep qualitative analysis, and developing and conducting audit experiments to measure influence in real-time online.
Applicants with expertise in quantitative (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing), qualitative (e.g., discourse analysis), computational social science, social computing, and HCI/CSCW are strongly encouraged to apply. The position can also provide an opportunity to learn new methodologies and approaches. We encourage applicants from backgrounds traditionally marginalized/underrepresented in the field to apply.
Position Duration: This is a two year position. The initial appointment is for a minimum of one year, with a strong possibility of reappointment in the 2nd year. This position will begin as early as January 1, 2022.
Postdoctoral Scholars are represented by UAW 4121 and are subject to the collective bargaining agreement, unless agreed exclusion criteria apply. For more information, please visit the University of Washington Labor Relations website.

Qualifications

Applicants must have a PhD in Information or Computer Science or a related field

Excellent written and verbal communication skills

An ability to work in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary environment, including demonstrated success in working with diverse populations

We will consider candidates who have accepted tenure-track positions at another institution but with the ability to defer their start date.

Instructions

A cover letter describing your interest in this position; and explicitly addressing past, present, and/or future (planned) contributions to equity, diversity, and inclusion.

A brief research statement that outlines your research achievements and goals and summarizes your qualifications for this position.

Curriculum vitae, including names and contact information of three references

Two published papers, or equivalent writing samples that demonstrate expertise and fit for the position

A link to a professional webpage, Google scholar page (if applicable), and github profile (if applicable).

NVIDIA’s invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics, and revolutionized parallel computing. More recently, GPU deep learning ignited modern AI — the next era of computing. With the GPU acting as the primary computing device, robots can now perceive and understand the world around them. Today, NVIDIA has transformed into “the AI computing company.” We're looking to grow our company, and build our teams with the smartest people in the world working on diverse aspects of AI. Join us at the frontier of technological advancement!
Robotics is an increasingly exciting field, influenced heavily by recent advances in hardware acceleration through devices such as the modern GPU. These advances have enabled tremendous progress in several areas of robotics, including manipulation, visual recognition, real-time tracking, and learning-based control. Robots are getting increasingly proficient at building 3D maps of their environments, detecting and tracking objects and people as they move through the world, learning controllers from realistic simulation, and understanding commands provided via gestures and natural language.
What you'll be doing:
While our ultimate goal is to reach human-level dexterity, perception, and adaptability, we still have a long way to go. To enable the next generation of robots that can robustly operate in the physical world and interact with people in a natural way, progress is still needed in multiple domains: perception, planning, learning, and control. Moreover, even more importantly, the integration of these individual contributions into complete robot systems opens new challenges.
Toward this goal, the NVIDIA Robotics Research Lab brings together a diverse, interdisciplinary research team working on core robotics topics ranging from control, perception, machine learning, common sense reasoning, task planning, human-robot collaboration, and critical related areas such as deep learning for computer vision, natural language processing and decision making.
The lab focuses on fundamental research questions in robotics and lab members are encouraged to publish their research and open source their code. The lab hosts numerous internships every year to foster education and communication, and the team is encouraged to collaborate broadly with institutions outside of NVIDIA, both academic and industrial. NVIDIA is well known for its team culture, and lab researchers are able to closely interact with others within the company who are experts in broad subtopics such as computer vision, computer graphics, GPU computing, AI and Deep Learning, self-driving cars, and physics-based simulation.
The following research areas are of particular interest:
Robot manipulation, robot control, reinforcement learning, computer vision, human-robot interaction, deep learning, physics-based simulation, neuro symbolic reasoning, and natural language processing.
What we need to see:
Pursuing PhD in Robotics, Computer Science, Engineering or related field.
3+ years of relevant research or work experience
Knowledge of theory and practice of robotics, or a related area with a strong interest in connecting your work to robotics scenarios.
A track record of research excellence with your work published in top conferences and journals such as Robotics (RSS, ICRA, IROS, CoRL, T-RO, IJRR), Machine Learning (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI, JMLR), Computer Vision (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, TPAMI) and Language (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL).
Exceptional programming skills in Python, and deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow and Pytorch. Fluency in C/C++; CUDA and robotics frameworks such as ROS is a plus.
Strong communication and interpersonal skills are required along with the ability to work in a dynamic, research focused team. A demonstrated history of mentoring junior engineers and interns is a huge plus.
Are you dedicated, upbeat and dynamic with excellent analytical ability? Are you a researcher or an engineer passionate and highly motivated about solving complex problems? If so, you may be a perfect fit for NVIDIA!
NVIDIA is committed to fostering a diverse work environment and proud to be an equal opportunity employer. As we highly value diversity in our current and future employees, we do not discriminate (including in our hiring and promotion practices) on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender expression , sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status or any other characteristic protected by law."

To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Data is at the core of Outreach's strategy. It drives ourselves and our customers to the highest levels of success. We use it for everything from customer health scores and revenue dashboards, to operational metrics of our AWS infrastructure, to helping increase product engagement and user productivity through natural language understanding, to predictive analytics and causal inference via experimentation. As our customer base continues to grow, we are looking towards new ways of leveraging our data to deeper understand our customers’ needs and deliver new products and features to help continuously improve their customer engagement workflows.
The mission of the Data Science team is to enable such continuous optimization by modeling customer engagement workflows, developing metrics to measure success and efficiency of these workflows and providing insights and tools to support execution and optimization of these workflows. As a member of the team, you will be on the ground floor working with Product Managers, Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, Application Engineers and executives to define and implement our strategy for delivering on this mission.
As a manager of the Sales Process Optimization team you will be responsible for defining and implementing algorithms and engineering platforms for automated optimization of sales workflows, aka sales playbooks.

Are you passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning? Are you passionate about helping customers build solutions leveraging the state-of-the-art AI/ML/DL tools on Amazon Web Service (AWS)? Come join us!

At Amazon, we’ve been investing deeply in artificial intelligence for over 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers experience are driven by machine learning. Amazon.com’s recommendations engine is driven by machine learning (ML), as are the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers. Our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are also informed by ML algorithms. Alexa is fueled by Natural Language Understanding and Automated Speech Recognition deep learning; as is Prime Air, and the computer vision technology in our new retail experience, Amazon Go. We have thousands of engineers at Amazon committed to machine learning and deep learning, and it’s a big part of our heritage.

Within AWS, we’re focused on bringing that knowledge and capability to customers through three layers of the AI stack: 1) Frameworks and Infrastructure with tools like Apache MxNet and TensorFlow, 2) Machine Learning Platforms such as Amazon SageMaker for data scientists and 3) API-driven Services like Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Forecast, Amazon Personalize, Amazon Rekognition, Lookout for Equipment, Monitron, Lookout for Metric, Panorama, Lookout for Vision, Health AI, and Amazon Textract to quickly add intelligence to applications with a simple API call.

AWS is looking for an AI Services Solutions Architect (Artificial Intelligence SA) for Personalization, who will be the Subject Matter Expert (SME) for helping customers in designing Personalization solutions that leverage our AI services. You will partner with Solution Architects, Sales, Business Development and the AI Service teams to enable customer adoption and revenue attainment for various AWS AI services. You will develop white papers, blogs, reference implementations, labs, and presentations to evangelize AWS AI design patterns and best practices for Personalization solutions. And, most important - you will act as the steward for developing winning Personalization solutions for our customers.

Roles and Responsibilities

Thought Leadership – Evangelize AWS AI services and share best practices through forums such as AWS blogs, white-papers, reference architectures and public-speaking events such as AWS Summit, AWS re: Invent, etc.
Partner with SAs, Sales, Business Development and the AI Service teams to accelerate customer adoption and revenue attainment in the AMERICAS for AI services such as Amazon Personalize, Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Transcribe and the other AI services.
Act as a technical liaison between customers and the AI services engineering teams to provide customer driven product improvement feedback.
Develop and support an AWS internal community of AI related subject matter experts.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have twelve employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship.

Postdoctoral Scholar - Computational Social Science,University of Washington,"Seattle, WA 98195 (University District area)",4.1,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=474e1a9fb706ad52&fccid=142783ac2edbe56b&vjs=3,"Position Overview

Organization: Information School

Title: Postdoctoral Scholar - Computational Social Science

Position Details
Position Description

The University of Washington, Information School (UW iSchool) invites applications for a Postdoctoral Scholar to work with Dr. Tanu Mitra on an ONR-YIP funded project titled “Influencing Communities and Narratives: New Techniques for Understanding Adversarial Influence Online.”
In collaboration with Dr. Mitra and her students, the postdoctoral scholar will contribute primarily to the above project, along with any other projects they may be interested in exploring on the topic of adversarial online influence and misinformation.
The Postdoctoral Scholar will also have the opportunity to engage with researchers at the Center for an Informed Public (CIP). The CIP is a multidisciplinary institute with a core mission aiming to resist strategic misinformation, promote an informed society, and strengthen democratic discourse. The CIP offers an exceptional opportunity to work closely with the Center’s faculty, including sociologists, information scientists, computer scientists, and policy experts. Located in Seattle, the position also offers opportunities for engagement with scholars and industry leaders in the area.
The project aims to study how adversarial online influence looks like in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), particularly, in the Indian subcontinent through a series of large-scale quantitative analysis and experiments conducted on social media. Specific questions that the project will answer include: 1) What are the key vectors of adversarial influence operations in the IOR? How do mainstream media interact with new media (social media) and how do adversaries utilize this landscape to launch influence operations online in the IOR? 2) How do we characterize community-based and narrative-based influence in the region? 3) How can we interrogate and audit algorithms for adversarial influence in the IOR? This work will involve collecting and analyzing data from multiple social media platforms, constructing machine learning models, complementing quantitative analysis work with deep qualitative analysis, and developing and conducting audit experiments to measure influence in real-time online.
Applicants with expertise in quantitative (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing), qualitative (e.g., discourse analysis), computational social science, social computing, and HCI/CSCW are strongly encouraged to apply. The position can also provide an opportunity to learn new methodologies and approaches. We encourage applicants from backgrounds traditionally marginalized/underrepresented in the field to apply.
Position Duration: This is a two year position. The initial appointment is for a minimum of one year, with a strong possibility of reappointment in the 2nd year. This position will begin as early as January 1, 2022.
