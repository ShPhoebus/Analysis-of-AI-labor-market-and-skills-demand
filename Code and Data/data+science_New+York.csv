We meet Americans at their place of work by embedding our products within the scheduling, workforce management, and payroll apps they already use every day. And, as a social impact fintech, our promise to our users is simple: we'll never charge our users to access the money they've already worked for.

We welcome people who add a new set of experiences to our melting pot of backgrounds. We're 30-ish, spread across multiple states, hailing from various countries. We've got grandparents working alongside recent graduates, Americans partnering with immigrants, and self-taught coders debating with Ivy League graduates. We embrace diversity in all its forms.

We are backed by investors who are not only well-renowned in their fields, but are also great partners for us. We've raised $19.5 million from Thrive Capital, Upfront Ventures, Founder Collective, and Walkabout VC, as well as many individual investors like Michael Vaughan (Former COO of Venmo) and Paul Appelbaum (Founder of Seamless).

At Runway, we’re building a next-generation creative tool that enables a new level of interactivity with cloud-based machine learning models. For our tool to be maximally expressive, it needs to establish a seamless feedback loop between its users and the machine learning models powering its abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible.
For this reason, we’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can help us create the server-side engine that powers our interactive tools for image and video synthesis. You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments. The best fit for the role is someone who is deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems design, and has extensive experience building web-based real-time server applications.
This is a full-time role. We are based in New York, but welcome remote applications from everywhere
About the company
Runway is building the next generation of creative tools. We are a small team of artists, engineers, developers, and researchers working together to predict-by-inventing the future. Our team members used to work at NYU, Disney Research, IBM Research, Linode, and Stanford.
We have built a tool that makes machine learning easy and accessible for all types of creatives. And our users love it. But our vision is bigger. We are transforming how content and media is created. For decades, media creation has relied on incremental iterations of the same old tools. And while some of those tools have become smarter in recent years, they're still very much rooted in an outdated paradigm. We've been stuck with the same old Creative Suite for way too long. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will not just bring automation at every scale, but a significant change in how we create. That's why Runway is reimagining how we create, so we can create new things.

Runway has an active and growing community of artists and creators all over the world. IBM, Google, R/GA, New Balance, Chanel, and dozen of companies are using Runway to create and explore new creative boundaries. Runway is also used to teach at a wide variety of institutions. From architectural programs at MIT to self-organized independent workshops in Perú.
We are a young company and this role is a unique opportunity to join a market-defining company in its early stages.
Requirements:
Solid knowledge of at least one machine learning research framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), and at least one high-performance inference framework (e.g. TensorRT, Apache TVM).
Experience profiling and optimizing deep neural networks, including knowledge of GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight.
Familiarity with Python-based image and video manipulation/encoding/decoding frameworks, such as OpenCV and PyAV.
Experience with cloud orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.
Opinionated about writing robust and maintainable client-server architectures and APIs.
Ability to rapidly prototype solutions and iterate on them with tight product deadlines.
Strong communication, collaboration, and documentation skills."

Cash App is the fastest growing financial brand in the world. Built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic money app with over 36 million active monthly users.
Loved by customers and by pop culture, we’ve held the #1 spot in finance on the App Store for almost two years, and our social media posts see more engagement in a day than most financial brands see in a year.
With major offices in San Francisco, New York, St. Louis, Portland, Kitchener-Waterloo, Toronto and Melbourne, Cash App is bringing a better way to send, spend, and save to anyone who has ever sought an alternative to today’s banking system.

Job Description

Our team is continuing to grow and we’re looking for Engineers with experience developing ML pipelines and infrastructure to join us and build out the next generation platform to power use cases across the company. Across the team, we employ methods ranging from simple heuristics to Deep Learning technology to improve our performance and services. We’re also excited to explore new directions with the team to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
Our ML Engineers operate embedded in product-focused Workstreams and work in close collaboration with Data Scientists, ML Modelers and Software Engineers from across Cash App. Here are some Workstreams that are currently growing:
Identity
The ML Identity team focuses on providing AI-based opportunities to establish and verify Cash App's customer identities across the services we provide. This team works to build out both security and accessibility for Cash App users. We're a small team of engineers focused on exploring AI longshots, balancing a passion for advancing what's possible with a commitment to positive real-world impact.

In addition, we are continually evolving our platform to scale up in line with Cash App’s global expansion, and to provide the rapid payments platform that our customers expect and demand.
Banking
The Banking ML team focuses on all things ML related to the Cash Card and Banking at Cash. There is an element of risk and fraud prevention involved. From building pipelines and models to combat fraud on every Cash Card transaction and activation, to building out data models and pipelines to enable a large expansion of Cash Check Deposits. We are a new team that was created to support the fast growing banking space within Cash App. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that our customers experience safe and reliable Banking with Cash App.
Customer Support
The Cash Customer Support ML team has a vision to provide customer support that’s better than humans through ML. We’re a mixed team of engineers and modellers that work together to deliver models that help us support our customers when they run into problems. We currently use ML automation on two support channels: email and in-app chat. We’re actively working towards making these perform better and we’re always looking for innovative solutions to help our customers with ML.
Problems you’d work on:
Design elegant ML pipelines and services as well as prototype new approaches and productionize solutions at scale for our 36+ million active users
Create a world class platform for training, hosting and maintaining ML models
Apply ML and engineering best practices to shape how Cash App develops, tests and maintains ML-platform solutions
Help design and execute our long-term Machine Learning strategy across Cash App

Experience helping your teammates grow through mentorship and providing constructive feedback
A desire to be hands-on and help invent the future of AI
The ability to work autonomously in the rapidly evolving world of ML
Experience or knowledge in ML is helpful but not a prerequisite: if you are a solid software engineer, then we are happy to train you up in the mysterious ways of ML

Python, Java and Kotlin
Tensorflow and PyTorch
AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes

The Data Science Team

Our Data Science Team is dedicated to aggressively applying the scientific method to high velocity technical innovation across the entire spectrum of the company, from business and markets, to predictive systems and hardware for clients and customers.

We are experts in understanding failure and spend every minute of every day cultivating deeper and stronger abilities to bring ourselves to the edge of it just before catastrophe strikes. Of course we do miss - and so will you, but together we will learn from each crash and use it to push the limits even further.

If you are willing to admit daily that you have more to learn, we are looking for you. If you are dedicated to jumping just as fast to pick up the dirty work as you are the beautiful work, we are looking for you.

You have experience in full-stack development, ideally on top of Ruby on Rails, but we're flexible.
You understand the value of well-designed, well-documented, discoverable APIs and you are willing to build, maintain, and evolve them.

With Pollen+ you can pick from a highly curated selection of world class festivals and events such as Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits and Wireless festival. With Pollen Presents you can discover experiences only available through us, where we bring every major category of entertainment including music, sport and lifestyle to the most exciting destinations in the world such as Las Vegas, Ibiza and Los Cabos.

We are growing fast, with over 500 million in sales to date across hundreds of experiences at more than fifty of the best destinations globally. We have offices throughout North America and Europe, and have raised more than $100 million in venture funding from Northzone, Draper, Kindred, Backed and Sienna Capital.

As a Data Scientist you will drive analysis and participate in projects that directly shape the strategy of the business. You will be joining an entrepreneurial team within the wider business who are responsible for both helping determine Pollen's strategic direction and making those plans a reality. You should be whip-smart and curious, analytical, eager to learn and explore, and have an entrepreneurial drive to help shape the future strategy of Pollen.
In the first 6 months you will:

Optimise customer engagement through statistical analysis and experimentation.
In order to optimize our marketing strategies, improve our growth tactics and elevate our CRM processes, we need to uncover the most effective ways that can drive our customers to move from the least engaging to the most exciting stages of their Pollen journey.

You are successful when your recommendations are implemented and lead to increases in customer engagement.

Partner with marketing and research teams as part of a wider storytelling optimization project

You will participate in this mixed methods project, identifying the asset types, asset characteristics, emotional hooks and core value props that are most impactful with our customers, of differing cohorts. You will be successful when we have developed a storytelling playbook, per customer segment and experience type, that guides the development of our core marketing strategies, cadence and timing.

Collaborate with other insights professionals, data professionals and non-technical stakeholders to gather the necessary data to help drive strategic decision making.
You will be joining a diverse insights function with employees all across the insights spectrum, from Market Research to broader Strategy Analytics. This means that you will need to be an effective communicator and collaborator with non-technical partners, who will frequently be providing the data you need to conduct your analyses. You are successful when your data partners have a clear understanding of your support requirements, and your non-technical partners feel well supported by the data you provide.

Machine Learning Engineer,Runway AI,"New York, NY",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=5b1c0366f01b20db&fccid=8375224c1881aba2&vjs=3,"About the role
At Runway, we’re building a next-generation creative tool that enables a new level of interactivity with cloud-based machine learning models. For our tool to be maximally expressive, it needs to establish a seamless feedback loop between its users and the machine learning models powering its abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible.
For this reason, we’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can help us create the server-side engine that powers our interactive tools for image and video synthesis. You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments. The best fit for the role is someone who is deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and systems design, and has extensive experience building web-based real-time server applications.
This is a full-time role. We are based in New York, but welcome remote applications from everywhere
About the company
Runway is building the next generation of creative tools. We are a small team of artists, engineers, developers, and researchers working together to predict-by-inventing the future. Our team members used to work at NYU, Disney Research, IBM Research, Linode, and Stanford.
We have built a tool that makes machine learning easy and accessible for all types of creatives. And our users love it. But our vision is bigger. We are transforming how content and media is created. For decades, media creation has relied on incremental iterations of the same old tools. And while some of those tools have become smarter in recent years, they're still very much rooted in an outdated paradigm. We've been stuck with the same old Creative Suite for way too long. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will not just bring automation at every scale, but a significant change in how we create. That's why Runway is reimagining how we create, so we can create new things.

Runway has an active and growing community of artists and creators all over the world. IBM, Google, R/GA, New Balance, Chanel, and dozen of companies are using Runway to create and explore new creative boundaries. Runway is also used to teach at a wide variety of institutions. From architectural programs at MIT to self-organized independent workshops in Perú.
We are a young company and this role is a unique opportunity to join a market-defining company in its early stages.
Requirements:
Solid knowledge of at least one machine learning research framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), and at least one high-performance inference framework (e.g. TensorRT, Apache TVM).
Experience profiling and optimizing deep neural networks, including knowledge of GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight.
Familiarity with Python-based image and video manipulation/encoding/decoding frameworks, such as OpenCV and PyAV.
Experience with cloud orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.
Opinionated about writing robust and maintainable client-server architectures and APIs.
Ability to rapidly prototype solutions and iterate on them with tight product deadlines.
Strong communication, collaboration, and documentation skills."

Our ML Engineers operate embedded in product-focused Workstreams and work in close collaboration with Data Scientists, ML Modelers and Software Engineers from across Cash App. Here are some Workstreams that are currently growing:
Identity
The ML Identity team focuses on providing AI-based opportunities to establish and verify Cash App's customer identities across the services we provide.

Banking
The Banking ML team focuses on all things ML related to the Cash Card and Banking at Cash. There is an element of risk and fraud prevention involved. From building pipelines and models to combat fraud on every Cash Card transaction and activation, to building out data models and pipelines to enable a large expansion of Cash Check Deposits. We are a new team that was created to support the fast growing banking space within Cash App. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that our customers experience safe and reliable Banking with Cash App.
Customer Support
The Cash Customer Support ML team has a vision to provide customer support that’s better than humans through ML. We’re a mixed team of engineers and modellers that work together to deliver models that help us support our customers when they run into problems. We currently use ML automation on two support channels: email and in-app chat. We’re actively working towards making these perform better and we’re always looking for innovative solutions to help our customers with ML.

Data is at the core of Penguin Random House’s success and has fast become an integral part of how we drive our business model. We’re adding several positions to the Data Science team, starting with a Senior Data Scientist in a measurement and optimization focused role.
As a Senior Data Scientist on the team, you will have the opportunity to advance several strategic projects under the umbrella of measurement and optimization, including measuring marketing event driven sales, attribution modelling, creating a ROI optimizer across marketing channels, real-time keyword and campaign optimization, experimenting with and evaluating one off marketing levers, and conducting A/B testing, among others. We’re proud to be able to say that we’re at the start of an exciting new stage within our journey, where you’ll gain a LOT of exposure to more parts of the business than most in what is a highly visible group. Our directors report into the Vice President, who reports into the COO, so you’ll regularly be exposed to C-level executives!
You will ideally come with a collaborative, R&D-oriented, and analytical mindset. The role emphasizes written communication and a continuous documentation of learnings, as well as the ability to convey complex technical results to a non-technical audience.
Responsibilities:
While measurement and optimization remain the focus of your responsibilities, it also intersects with many other parts of the business. In addition to working closely with the Data Science team on these areas, you’ll also need to collaborate regularly with decision makers across the business to tackle industry-specific problems.
At Penguin Random House, you will:
Take full ownership of the current infrastructure around marketing mix modelling
Optimize and scale the business impact of existing automated pipelines, identify efficiency gains, and take the initiative to improve them
Oversee experiment design and the causal inference workstream, from early data exploration to analysis and delivering results
Measure and evaluate event-driven sales from promotions, digital merchandising, market shocks, and yearly seasonality
Study first and second order impacts of Amazon media spend at both the aggregate and keyword specific levels, with the goal of turning research findings into actionable recommendations for stakeholders
Apply statistical rigor to supply chain issues and build production level models for inventory optimization
Requirements:
An undergraduate degree in statistics, economics, mathematics, computer science, industrial engineering, data science, or a social science with a quantitative focus
4+ years of professional experience programming in either R or Python (R preferred)
Aptitude with shell scripting, debugging tools, containerized environments, and any flavor of Linux
Experience executing and managing field experiments; familiarity with probability-based sampling designs
Familiarity with automated feature engineering, data imputation, and working with large datasets
A track record of applied Bayesian modeling/inference or machine learning techniques to real world data
Ability to communicate complex technical concepts to a business audience
Proficiency using Git version control software to contribute to a shared repository/codebase
Data munging skills; experience working with relational databases and fluency in SQL
Full-time employees are eligible for our comprehensive benefits program. Our range of benefits include, but are not limited to, Medical/Prescription drug insurance, Dental, Vision, Health Care/Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account, Health Savings Account, Pre-Tax and Roth 401(k), Short and Long-Term Disability Insurance, Life/AD&D Insurance, Commuter Benefits, Student Loan Repayment Program, Educational Assistance & generous paid time off.

These systems are putting the entire ecosystem and three way value exchange at risk by providing an incomplete and siloed view of the audience that are responsible for advertising waste from inflated metrics, a decrease in publisher revenue opportunity from under-representing their audiences and consumers stuck with suboptimal viewing experiences.Today the industry standard tools are usually designed where connectivity and applications of consumer data sets often come with negative trade off for consumer privacy or security risks of leaking private data. We envision a world where this doesn't have to be the case - a world where consumer privacy, security, and governance are incorporated into the fabric of the codebase that interfaces with these systems to enable the necessary business use-cases that keep these viewing experiences free or affordable to everyone.The mission of VideoAmp is to be the independent software and data company creating a more sophisticated data-driven advertising ecosystem that redefines how media is valued, bought and sold. Our platform provides measurement and optimization tools that unifies audiences across the disparate systems of traditional TV, streaming video and digital media. We are unlocking new value for those that currently operate within a siloed view of their audiences, creating efficiencies for the entire industry.

We are experts in understanding failure and spend every minute of every day cultivating deeper and stronger abilities to bring ourselves to the edge of it just before catastrophe strikes. Of course we do miss - and so will you, but together we will learn from each crash and use it to push the limits even further.

If you are willing to admit daily that you have more to learn, we are looking for you. If you are dedicated to jumping just as fast to pick up the dirty work as you are the beautiful work, we are looking for you. If you are willing to become dedicated to the scientific process, and not the project, we are looking for you. Join us.

What you'll do:

Build, optimize and scale new technologies and services developed within the the Data Science ecosystem
Transition new technologies and services from research into the production environment using proper methods and procedures
Help build and connect back-end and front-end processes/software to new and existing technologies and services

Our Data Science tech stack includes but is not limited to: R, R shiny, Python, AWS, SQL, and multitudes of various data resources (APIs, Scrapers, etc)

Experience:

You have experience building and supporting mission-critical production applications. The number of years is less important than the fact that you've lived the full product lifecycle multiple times, from idea to maturity, and have learned what works and what doesn't.
You have experience in full-stack development, ideally on top of Ruby on Rails, but we're flexible.
You understand the value of well-designed, well-documented, discoverable APIs and you are willing to build, maintain, and evolve them.

You take an analytical but pragmatic approach to problem solving.
You're excited to architect systems for improving scalability and maintainability across our codebase.

How is that for math, 50% of our focus is on YOU! We don't care if you want to learn how to build cutting edge A.I. or just learn how to weave reed baskets, the entire team is there to support you and help lift you as high as we can.

You have experience in full-stack development, ideally on top of Ruby on Rails, but we're flexible.

Sidewalk Labs is an urban innovation company that tackles cities' greatest challenges. We create products and solutions, invest in new companies, and help developers build more sustainable, innovative, and equitable places around the world. Our ambitious vision requires us to push ourselves beyond conventional thinking, and we work hard in pursuit of our mission. Our cross-disciplinary team consists of experts from real estate, urban planning, government, finance, technology, and engineering, among other backgrounds.

Our urban innovations include Delve (a generative design product that empowers real estate teams to design better, faster, with less risk), Mesa (an easy-install kit for commercial buildings that cuts energy costs, improves tenant comfort, and simplifies building operations), Pebble (a low-cost vehicle sensor to help manage parking and curb space), and Affordable Electrification (a new way to manage home energy use to meet a customer's monthly budget). We're also developing an offsite construction company that can deliver high-quality mass timber buildings for more sustainable living and working.

Work with building energy experts to develop, test, and evaluate new control algorithms to improve buildings' energy efficiency and surface operational insights.
Build tools and systems to scale deployment of models and pipelines.

What we expect:

Know your software engineering.
Have a strong CS background in order to choose the right algorithms, systems approaches and patterns to solve problems, without reinventing the wheel.
Candidates need to be able to hit the ground running. Therefore, for this role we are looking for 2+ years of industry experience.

Strong ability to write production code quickly.
You are obsessed with privacy and constantly ask how we can build privacy into product design.
Be comfortable with a range of languages and open source tools and frameworks, and make good decisions about which to use to solve a particular problem. You are excited to learn something new when the need arises.
Solve problems, together.
Come up with novel solutions, working well with technologists and non-technologists alike.
Ask hard questions and challenge assumptions to ensure that we're solving the right problems.
Have flexibility to work on the team's most pressing problems.
Care.
About cities, solving hard problems, and our team's success.

Bowery builds smart indoor farms near cities, growing fresher, pesticide-free Protected Produce with bold flavor in precisely controlled environments, 365 days a year. At the heart of each farm is the proprietary BoweryOS, which integrates software, hardware, sensors, AI, computer vision systems, machine learning models and robotics to orchestrate and automate the entirety of its operations. As a result, each farm creates far less waste and uses a fraction of the water and land compared to traditional agriculture.

About The Role:
Data Science at Bowery means building production-facing data products which automate the agricultural and operational functions in our network of indoor vertical farms. The Data & AI function at Bowery is central to the vision of the company as well as its day to day operation. You’ll work with our team of data scientists and analysts as well as agricultural scientists and supply chain managers who bring domain expertise to our data-driven solutions.
What You'll Do:
You’ll create innovative quantitative solutions and advance the state of indoor farming alongside mechanical engineers, agricultural scientists, and the farm operations team.
You'll combine agricultural considerations with production demands to maximize plant growth and fulfillment probability.
You’ll optimize work and production schedules to achieve the highest utilization of grow time and space in the farm.
You’ll use the key drivers of Bowery's business and agricultural science to design experimental frameworks to ensure data integrity and empower us to more easily analyze and act upon data from new trials.
You'll analyze historical data related to crop growth and environmental characteristics to forecast yields for future harvests and uncover insights about ways conditions can be optimized.
You'll help shape the way our data science team does work - researching and making key decisions about what we build, how we build it, and which tools are best for solving our problems.
You'll work alongside software engineers to implement data processing and visualization systems that make data readily available and simplify how insights are communicated.
You won’t target ads, optimize signup funnels, or recommend anything for anyone to click on.
Who You Are:
You have a strong mathematical background in probability, statistics, and optimization algorithms.
You are fluent in Python and enjoy building software the team can depend on.
You are proficient with SQL and can work “full stack” to integrate solutions with our data ecosystem.
You have a deep understanding of and have applied various machine learning techniques for solving real-world problems.
You are energized by translating business, operations, and agricultural questions into data science problems, solving those problems, and interpreting the output back into clear outcomes.
You are confident in taking ownership of projects from start to finish and enjoy the process of turning nebulous ideas into reality.
Who We Are:
Bowery is a place where everyone is welcome, included and empowered to reach their full potential.
We live our shared values every day in both big and small ways: opt-in, think wildly different, break barriers together & be kind to the core We are a mission-driven team of unconventional thinkers, problem-solvers, optimists and activators.
We share a passion for giving back more to the planet than we take, growing deliciously abundant food without abundant harm.
We are excited to hear from you!
Based in New York City, Bowery is the largest vertical farming company in the United States, serving major e-commerce platforms and more than 850 grocery stores in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, including Albertsons Companies (Safeway and Acme), Amazon Fresh, Giant Food, Walmart, Weis, Whole Foods Market, and specialty grocers, with produce that's harvested year-round at peak freshness, delivered within days of harvest.

From our expansive library of content, to the tools we provide, to our company work culture, we're constantly evolving towards being the best advocates for our artists and employees. If you work at Splice you'll be asked, ""what does music mean to you?"" That's because music is at the core of everything we do. It's why we hire trailblazers to help us solve problems, navigate uncharted territory, and change the industry for the better. It's why we seek out diversity in who we hire, represent and collaborate with to ensure that we're growing towards a more inclusive and open minded reality. And it's why we hold ourselves accountable for our part in shaping music creation.

Skills we're looking for:
Data manipulation

We expect our Data Scientists to have strong analytical SQL skills. This means fluidity constructing statements that rely on a combination of joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions. This role will work with large-scale data, so this person must have experience writing efficient, performance-optimized queries.

Metric creation

This individual will be responsible for taking in loosely structured problems or objectives and devising useful metrics that drive us toward solutions. This process will require taking on a user-centric perspective to identify key behavioral patterns in our products and translate these into metrics that will be used in decision making—in a sense, choosing the optimal methodology while also thoughtfully constructing scalable and intuitive user interfaces for whatever metric or analysis is built.

Analysis

Most problems benefit from models that can be interpreted to drive human action. We're seeking an individual who enjoys experimentation and statistical analysis—someone who can translate what they see in the data into useful product recommendations. A thorough understanding of statistical inference is required.

Technical requirements
Strong experience with analytical SQL (ideally BigQuery, Snowflake, or a similar MPP data warehouse).
Hands-on experience with self-service analytics tools (e.g., Looker, Mixpanel, Tableau).
Training in statistics or econometrics, with plenty of real-world experience applying these methodologies.
Familiarity with a programming language typically used for statistical analysis and machine learning (preferably Python).
Exposure to a variety of data sets used for product analytics—chiefly, large-scale event data (e.g., Mixpanel, Segment, GA 360, or Snowplow) and normalized transactional databases (e.g., e-commerce or subscription datasets).
Additional comments

There are no specific degree requirements for this role: we appreciate and seek out diverse backgrounds. Instead of any particular formal education requirement, we'll flesh out what you've built, what you know, and how you approach problem solving.

As a company that serves musicians and producers, some knowledge of the music-production process is definitely an asset. If this topic is new to you, that's okay—you should be open to learning about it.

Equal Opportunity Employer:

Splice is an equal opportunity employer, committed to diversity and inclusiveness. We will consider all qualified applicants without regard to race, color, nationality, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, disability or age."
