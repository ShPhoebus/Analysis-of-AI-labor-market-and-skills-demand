Chief of Staff,Clarify Health Solutions.,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=ce08f845efc648ea&fccid=a43657d8af5c59dd&vjs=3,"Company Overview

Our mission is to empower the delivery of better care and therapies through actionable insights.

Healthcare is challenging. Too often, we and those we love fail to receive the care we deserve due to delayed, impersonal, incomplete or hard-to-understand information. Economists estimated that up to 20-30% of healthcare spending fails to meaningfully move outcomes and is wasted. In the US alone, this adds up to nearly $1 trillion per year that could be re-directed to additional access to care, new roads, and better schools.

One of the biggest drivers of this confusion and waste is a lack of easily accessible, timely and personalized information on how to optimize each and every healthcare journey.

We believe we can change healthcare by deliberately bringing together healthcare experience, Silicon Valley big data software engineering, and cutting-edge data science to deliver innovative solutions to pervasive problems.

Clarify Health is a rapidly growing technology company whose enterprise analytics cloud transforms healthcare data into actionable insights for providers, health plans, and life sciences companies. Our Insights Platform powers highly automated business applications that enable customers to drive growth, optimize networks, improve care delivery, manage population health, maximize value-based care performance, and commercialize pharmaceutical and biotechnology products. We are proud to be redefining the science behind understanding and predicting individual patient journeys and cohorts. With intuitive, on-demand interrogation of over 300 million longitudinal patient journeys, Clarify enables healthcare organizations to leapfrog from traditionally cumbersome and manual analytics, unlocking self-service and rapid generation of insights that result in better health and outcomes

Clarify Health brings together committed and passionate colleagues with backgrounds in big data and AI engineering from financial services together with extensive clinical operations expertise. The team has a track record of achieving over $1 billion in improvement at more than 125 health systems, payers, and pharmaceutical companies, and deploying cloud-based software at over 5,000 institutions.

Simulation is building a platform to accelerate the development and testing of the entire AV technology stack for both hardware and software. We collaborate with teams like AV engineering, systems, and testing to deliver the tools that accelerate development and validation in order to quickly and safely launch new AV capabilities.
Achieving large-scale, commercial AV deployments fundamentally relies on having a powerful and accurate simulation that can test and verify AV behavior across a multitude of virtual driving scenarios without relying on extensive real-world testing and data collection. Developing truly driverless vehicles for ride-hail and goods delivery means Cruise will increasingly rely on Simulation for not just test and validation but also to uncover challenging driving scenarios that will accelerate the development of core AV technologies like Perception and Motion Planning. We're at the forefront of AV technology development and serve as the biggest lever to transform AVs from a prototype into a real commercial product.

It is the essential source of information and ideas that make sense of a world in constant transformation. The WIRED conversation illuminates how technology is changing every aspect of our lives—from culture to business, science to design. The breakthroughs and innovations that we uncover lead to new ways of thinking, new connections, and new industries. WIRED reaches more than 30 million people each month through WIRED.com, our digital edition, the magazine, social media, and live events.
Job Description
The largest technology companies exercise world-changing market power. WIRED seeks a writer to cover these companies, with a particular focus on Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple.
This role spans both the business/economic and social impacts of these companies’ power, and your underlying question will always be how this power is changing the world, both for better and for worse. You’ll track these companies as they expand into new markets and business lines, exploring the potential of new products and economic opportunities they create, and reporting on the strategies they use to outmaneuver or quash competitors and influence regulators, politicians, and the public. You may also cover them through the stories of their smaller rivals, of companies that depend on their economic ecosystems—such as sellers on Amazon or app developers for Apple—or of regulators or activists who tussle with them. You may look at how they tackle issues like misinformation and political manipulation, how they use their platforms to try to promote positive change such as voter participation or public health, and how their founders or top executives use their wealth philanthropically. And you may look at their influence around the world, particularly how they wield it in smaller countries or those with authoritarian regimes.
You should have some experience of covering Big Tech, and be excited by the prospect of storytelling across a wide range of formats, from breaking news and sharp, timely analysis to deeply reported narrative features. (If you’ve never written one of those, don’t worry: WIRED has some of the finest longform editors in the business, and we love helping people who’ve got reporting chops and raw writing talent grow into gifted storytellers.) You may also have the opportunity to take part in our podcasts, video series, or live events.
You’ll work with our experienced business editor, Scott Thurm, who will help you find avenues to focus on within this broad beat and develop lines of investigation that can yield scoops and original ideas. You’ll be part of a growing and increasingly global newsroom of smart, kind, nerdy, and well-informed colleagues who are always brimming with ideas and eager to help each other out. In particular, in this job you can expect to collaborate with folks such as Gilad Edelman, who covers tech policy and regulation; Cecilia D’Anastasio, our chief writer on the games industry, Tom Simonite, Will Knight, and Khari Johnson, our AI team; and Matt Burgess, who covers privacy and regulation in Europe.
Pandemic permitting, you can work out of WIRED’s offices in San Francisco, New York or London, but if you live in the United States or UK outside those cities you can be based remotely.
Primary responsibilities:
Pitch, report, and write stories on platforms and power beat, balancing news and analysis of the most important stories with original investigative reporting, features, or essays
Collaborate with other members of the business and national affairs teams in shaping the WIRED coverage agenda for Big Tech-related issues
Collaborate with audio, video, events, and social media teams as needed to develop ways of telling stories on other platforms
Skills and qualifications:
Experience as a technology or business journalist with a track record of original reporting on Big Tech
A clear, engaging, jargon-free writing style

Would you like have an impact on patients’ lives and contribute to eliminate cancer as a cause of death? If so then join us!
We’re investing like never before in our people, in growth, and in new diagnostic techniques and technologies. There are opportunities at every turn, with a variety and breadth that is uncommon to find and an industry-leading pipeline in oncology. Scientists at AstraZeneca are working every day to turn science fiction into science fact. Our ambition - to develop innovative, targeted medicines for every patient that needs them - and to match those treatments to patients most likely to benefit from them – is now a reality. This approach, known as Precision Medicine, is based on those individual characteristics that make some patients respond to treatment better than others. We use this knowledge to develop diagnostic tests that doctors can use to help prescribe the best treatment for each patient. Indeed, it’s now become common practice for patients with cancer to be offered such diagnostic tests before their treatment plan is agreed.
The AstraZeneca Companion Diagnostics Unit within the Precision Medicine and Biosamples function drives scientific leadership through the delivery of innovative companion diagnostics enabling our oncology ambition to transform the lives of patients living with cancer, and ultimately eliminate cancer as a cause of death.
We do this by:
Leading the development of diagnostics across AstraZeneca’s early and late stage oncology portfolios through close collaborations with our external diagnostic partners.
Leading the development and implementation of patient selection strategies to deliver companion diagnostics programs in support of our business priorities.
Leading companion diagnostic regulatory interactions to secure companion diagnostic approvals in major markets
Collaborate across AstraZeneca with colleagues in multiple Clinical functions plus commercial to help drive market uptake.
Developing strategies for early cancer detection, near patient testing and implementing testing options for minimal residual disease and early treatment interventions.
Utilising artificial intelligence diagnostic solutions and seeing software as a medical device.
Developing specific disease area strategies (e.g. lung cancer, breast cancer or hematological malignancies) and new diagnostic modalities.
Collaborating closely with fellow pharma companies on joint assets.
Join this fantastic, collaborative team and be part of our success; we have already delivered over 50 innovative/impactful companion/complementary oncology diagnostic approvals across the major markets of the US, EU, Japan and China since 2014 and we need you to help us take the next steps in patient-centric diagnostic development.
If this sounds like the type of organisation where you would like to grow your career and make a real difference to patients then we would like to hear from you.
We are currently looking for a Director.
Typical Accountabilities, what you will be doing:
As a Director, you’ll be a member of the Oncology Companion Diagnostic Unit (CDU). Your objective will be to ensure that innovative companion diagnostic tests or equivalent segmentation tools are delivered to our oncology drug projects. Drawing on world-class expertise and personal experience in companion diagnostic development you will ensure the adoption of Precision Medicine approaches within the AstraZeneca business. You will also provide leadership and support to a pool of fellow diagnostic experts to ensure delivery of a diagnostic strategy.
As an associate director this will entail developing and implementing the diagnostic strategy agreed by the respective development teams, and planning and leading Precision Medicine activities from a technical, financial, risk, regulatory, IP and partnering perspective. You will work collaboratively with colleagues at all levels in the Precision Medicine function to deliver this expertise to drug project teams.
Your role will also involve contributing to the personal development of project team members. Providing expert advice on strategic and innovative Precision Medicine approaches and companion diagnostic developments to development teams, you’ll be instrumental in ensuring that we adopt world-class practice in the field.
Education, Qualifications, Skills and Experience:
Essential:
Bachelor Degree
Experience of companion diagnostic tests or patient biomarker/segmentation tools in clinical development.

Chief of Staff,Clarify Health Solutions.,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=ce08f845efc648ea&fccid=a43657d8af5c59dd&vjs=3,"Company Overview

Our mission is to empower the delivery of better care and therapies through actionable insights.

Healthcare is challenging. Too often, we and those we love fail to receive the care we deserve due to delayed, impersonal, incomplete or hard-to-understand information. Economists estimated that up to 20-30% of healthcare spending fails to meaningfully move outcomes and is wasted. In the US alone, this adds up to nearly $1 trillion per year that could be re-directed to additional access to care, new roads, and better schools.

One of the biggest drivers of this confusion and waste is a lack of easily accessible, timely and personalized information on how to optimize each and every healthcare journey.

We believe we can change healthcare by deliberately bringing together healthcare experience, Silicon Valley big data software engineering, and cutting-edge data science to deliver innovative solutions to pervasive problems.

Clarify Health is a rapidly growing technology company whose enterprise analytics cloud transforms healthcare data into actionable insights for providers, health plans, and life sciences companies. Our Insights Platform powers highly automated business applications that enable customers to drive growth, optimize networks, improve care delivery, manage population health, maximize value-based care performance, and commercialize pharmaceutical and biotechnology products. We are proud to be redefining the science behind understanding and predicting individual patient journeys and cohorts. With intuitive, on-demand interrogation of over 300 million longitudinal patient journeys, Clarify enables healthcare organizations to leapfrog from traditionally cumbersome and manual analytics, unlocking self-service and rapid generation of insights that result in better health and outcomes

Clarify Health brings together committed and passionate colleagues with backgrounds in big data and AI engineering from financial services together with extensive clinical operations expertise.

Achieving large-scale, commercial AV deployments fundamentally relies on having a powerful and accurate simulation that can test and verify AV behavior across a multitude of virtual driving scenarios without relying on extensive real-world testing and data collection. Developing truly driverless vehicles for ride-hail and goods delivery means Cruise will increasingly rely on Simulation for not just test and validation but also to uncover challenging driving scenarios that will accelerate the development of core AV technologies like Perception and Motion Planning. We're at the forefront of AV technology development and serve as the biggest lever to transform AVs from a prototype into a real commercial product.

Simulation PMs own the tools and experiences that enable AV engineers and testers across Cruise to develop and test key components of the AV technology stack.

Cash App is the fastest growing financial brand in the world. Built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic money app with over 36 million active monthly users.
Loved by customers and by pop culture, we’ve held the #1 spot in finance on the App Store for almost two years, and our social media posts see more engagement in a day than most financial brands see in a year.
With major offices in San Francisco, New York, St. Louis, Portland, Kitchener-Waterloo, Toronto and Melbourne, Cash App is bringing a better way to send, spend, and save to anyone who has ever sought an alternative to today’s banking system.

Job Description
Machine Learning at Cash App has swiftly grown to become a central function of the business, with over 100 people working on solving some of the most cutting edge ML questions in FinTech. Our team is continuing to grow and we’re looking for Engineers with experience developing ML pipelines and infrastructure to join us and build out the next generation platform to power use cases across the company. Across the team, we employ methods ranging from simple heuristics to Deep Learning technology to improve our performance and services. We’re also excited to explore new directions with the team to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
Our ML Engineers operate embedded in product-focused Workstreams and work in close collaboration with Data Scientists, ML Modelers and Software Engineers from across Cash App. Here are some Workstreams that are currently growing:
Identity
The ML Identity team focuses on providing AI-based opportunities to establish and verify Cash App's customer identities across the services we provide. This team works to build out both security and accessibility for Cash App users. We're a small team of engineers focused on exploring AI longshots, balancing a passion for advancing what's possible with a commitment to positive real-world impact. The ML Identity engineering team is led by Kyle (who you'll report to) and this is a chance to work with us as a founding member.
Risk
The Risk team applies ML to protect our customers and our company’s bottom line from an ever changing landscape of fraud and platform abuse. We are continually refining and searching for new ways to leverage ML to stay ahead of ever more sophisticated fraud and scam patterns. In addition, we are continually evolving our platform to scale up in line with Cash App’s global expansion, and to provide the rapid payments platform that our customers expect and demand.
Banking
The Banking ML team focuses on all things ML related to the Cash Card and Banking at Cash. There is an element of risk and fraud prevention involved. From building pipelines and models to combat fraud on every Cash Card transaction and activation, to building out data models and pipelines to enable a large expansion of Cash Check Deposits. We are a new team that was created to support the fast growing banking space within Cash App. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that our customers experience safe and reliable Banking with Cash App.
Customer Support
The Cash Customer Support ML team has a vision to provide customer support that’s better than humans through ML. We’re a mixed team of engineers and modellers that work together to deliver models that help us support our customers when they run into problems. We currently use ML automation on two support channels: email and in-app chat. We’re actively working towards making these perform better and we’re always looking for innovative solutions to help our customers with ML.
Problems you’d work on:
Design elegant ML pipelines and services as well as prototype new approaches and productionize solutions at scale for our 36+ million active users
Create a world class platform for training, hosting and maintaining ML models
Apply ML and engineering best practices to shape how Cash App develops, tests and maintains ML-platform solutions
Help design and execute our long-term Machine Learning strategy across Cash App

Qualifications
You have:
A degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a related technical field. A graduate degree is a nice to have
3+ years of experience in software development and demonstrated technical initiative and leadership on previous projects
Curiosity and a passion for Cash App's mission of economic empowerment
Experience helping your teammates grow through mentorship and providing constructive feedback
A desire to be hands-on and help invent the future of AI
The ability to work autonomously in the rapidly evolving world of ML
Experience or knowledge in ML is helpful but not a prerequisite: if you are a solid software engineer, then we are happy to train you up in the mysterious ways of ML
Stack:
We value general engineering skill and versatility over existing domain knowledge, but here’s a sample of what we currently use:
Python, Java and Kotlin
Tensorflow and PyTorch
AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes
MySQL, DynamoDB, Kafka, Apache Beam and Google DataFlow
Additional Information
We’re working to build a more inclusive economy where our customers have equal access to opportunity, and we strive to live by these same values in building our workplace. Square is a proud equal opportunity employer. We work hard to evaluate all employees and job applicants consistently, without regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, pregnancy, gender expression or identity, sexual orientation, citizenship, or any other legally protected class.

Sr. ML Solutions Architect, AWS Startups

Do you like startups? Are you interested in cloud computing? Are you passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning? Yes? We have a role you might find interesting.

Startups are the large enterprises of the future. These young companies are founded by ambitious people who have a desire to build something meaningful and challenge the status quo. They seek to address underserved customers, or to challenge incumbents. They usually operate in an environment of scarcity: whether that’s capital, engineering resource, or experience. This is where you come in.

We are looking for technical builders with a background in AI and ML who love the idea of working with startups that differentiate their product via the application of Machine Learning. In this role, you’ll work directly with these customers, helping them make the build and deploy their products, services, and models in the cloud successfully. You’ll have a chance to build enduring relationships with these companies and establish yourself as a trusted advisor.

As well as spending time working directly with customers, you’ll also get plenty of time to “sharpen the saw” and keep your skills fresh. We have more than 175 services across a range of different categories and it’s important that we can help startups take advantages of the right ones. You’ll also play an important role as an advocate with our product teams to make sure we are building the right products and features for the startups you work with. And for the customers you don’t get to work with on a 1:1 basis you’ll share knowledge more broadly by working on technical content and presenting at events.

About the hiring group

The AWS Startup Solutions Architecture team is dedicated to working with these early stage startup companies as they build their businesses. We’re here to make sure that they can deploy the best, most scalable, and most secure architectures possible – and that they spend as little time and money as possible doing so.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have twelve employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we’re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded professional and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.

The ideal candidate will be an intellectual leader who can shape planning practice and policies to address contemporary challenges around climate change, urban inequality, racism, and uneven development. The candidate will be committed to serving as department chair, developing new initiatives and multidisciplinary collaborations, attracting externally-funded research, and demonstrating excellence in teaching, service, and research. We seek individuals whose work and experience have prepared them to contribute to our commitment to diversity and inclusion in higher education.

We seek a scholar in one of two related priority areas. The first area addresses housing or land markets through an urban lens. We are particularly interested in scholars examining inequality, segregation, racism, regional development, migration/immigration, urban-industrial restructuring and the global economy, economic development, fiscal policy, and whose work includes global or comparative perspectives. While applicants who use a range of methodological and theoretical approaches will be considered, they should be able to teach a core course in urban economics, along with courses aligned with their specific areas of interest, such as housing, urban real estate, urban public finance, spatial analytics, and economic development, among others.

The second priority area focuses on the management and impacts of rapidly evolving technologies on, and their manifestations in, different urban domains such as housing, transportation, energy, land use, governance, environmental sustainability, economic development, and design. We are especially interested in scholars who are familiar with cooperative problem solving using various methods of artificial intelligence as well as scholars using network analysis and conventional quantitative methods based on data science, and who are interested in bringing those methods to use in participatory planning or design processes; scholars who work on digital democracy approaches to urban planning and governance; and scholars whose work engages with rapidly changing technologies in order to anticipate and mitigate negative impacts such as inequality and social exclusion, algorithmic bias and racism, and cybersecurity risks, and to find opportunities to create positive outcomes for communities. Successful applicants will teach one or more core courses in the master's degree program in addition to possible courses on technology and the city, urban data science, technology and design studios, and visualization.

The department is committed to addressing the family needs of faculty, including dual career couples and single parents. We are also interested in candidates who have had non-traditional career paths or who have taken time off for family reasons, or who have achieved excellence in careers outside academia.

Team members can work primarily remotely. Starting in 2022, teams will meet in person every quarter in one of Grammarly’s hubs, currently in San Francisco, Vancouver, New York, and Kyiv. To ensure that teams are able to overlap in their working hours and to meet face-to-face when needed, all team members need to live within three time zones of their direct team.
Grammarly team members who will be collaborating at our Vancouver hub must be based in Canada.

The opportunity

Grammarly empowers people to thrive and connect, whenever and wherever they communicate. More than 30 million people and 30,000 teams around the world use our AI-powered writing assistant every day. All of this begins with our team collaborating in a values-driven and learning-oriented environment.

Effectively communicate technical machine learning results in a business context where most people are not machine learning experts.
Build the systems to help applied researchers scale their models in a production environment.
Design experiments, including for offline prototypes in a statistically sound way that will provide actionable data and enable us to make reliable decisions as we iterate on a project.
Promote excellence and best practices across the machine learning team in regards to research, implementation, tooling, and system design.
Work cross-functionally across multiple partner teams to get new features shipped across our many interfaces.
We’re looking for someone who
Embodies our EAGER values—is ethical, adaptable, gritty, empathetic, and remarkable.
Understands traditional machine learning algorithms and how to use them effectively in practice.
Is familiar with deep learning and its applications in industry.
Has a strong working knowledge of statistics as it relates to sampling methodologies and designing experiments
Understands data structures and algorithms at a level sufficient to write performant code when working with large datasets or large incoming data streams.
Is aware of NLP techniques to effectively work with very high-dimensional, sparse data.
Has enough experience with academic research to be comfortable reading and implementing papers to reproduce their results.
Support for you, professionally and personally
Professional growth: We hire people we trust, and we give team members autonomy to do their best work. We also support professional development with training, coaching, and regular feedback.
A connected team: Grammarly builds products that help people connect, and we apply this mindset to our own team. We have a highly collaborative culture supported by our EAGER values. We also take time to celebrate our colleagues and accomplishments with global, local, and team-specific events and programs.
Comprehensive benefits: Grammarly offers all team members competitive pay along with a benefits package that includes superior health care. We also offer support to set up a home office, ample and defined time off, gym and recreation stipends, admission discounts, and more.
We encourage you to apply

At Grammarly, we value our differences, and we encourage all—especially those whose identities are traditionally underrepresented in tech organizations—to apply. We do not discriminate on the basis of ancestry, race, place of origin, political belief, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, or any other characteristic protected by law.

Marketing teams at companies like TechStyle, Uber Eats, and Shapermint are our customers.

Smartly is on a mission to help advertisers unlock greater performance and creativity in social advertising by combining ad buying and creative automation. They have an established suite of ad buying and creative template tools loved by 700+ clients (across over $6.5B ad spend!), and are starting to move into creative optimization with Viralspace. Smartly is based in Helsinki but has satellite offices across the US, including San Francisco, where this role is based.

UI / UX Designer Role
You’ll be expected to own your space: work with all disciplines on your team to build, launch and iterate. You will work closely with the product team to conceptualize and execute on designs to solve problems for our products. This is a very rare opportunity that will put you in the position of total ownership of whole product from design perspective without the risk of starting your own company. Every designer at Hive has responsibility of a whole product, although we encourage the team to provide feedback to each other.
You are a talented designer who consistently delivers visuals and interactions of highest quality on timelines that would be unrealistic for many others. You take pride in your creative vision, execution and communication skills. You are a strong individual contributor, but also a team player. You enjoy taking ownership of full products, and are stifled by large design organizations.
You get a rush from seeing your designs live in the real world.
Responsibilities
Lead design projects across the entire product lifecycle and multiple product launches
Work with small multi-disciplinary teams. You’ll partner closely with engineering, product, and business folks to find elegant but practical solutions to design challenges
Be autonomous. You’ll take full ownership of your work, and you take responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way
Rapidly produce multiple concepts and prototypes; knowing when to apply pixel-perfect attention to detail, and when to make low-fi sketches and prototypes
Requirements
1+ year of experience designing consumer and mobile products
Had ownership of many consumer products over the years, and understand what it takes to create awesome, consumer-oriented experiences
Highly skilled in using design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, Sketch and/or Invision
Biased toward action and execution. You get nervous if you’re not sketching concepts, tweaking flows or polishing the designs that represent the big-thinking work
Great communication skills that help you work with product and engineering to make product visions come to life
Constantly looking to hone your design instinct through user feedback. Whether through hands-on user research, or by designing options for an A / B test
You have an online portfolio or PDF that you can share with us
Nice to Have
Work experience at a leading consumer technology company like Uber, Airbnb, Houzz, Square etc.

UI / UX Designer Role
You’ll be expected to own your space: work with all disciplines on your team to build, launch and iterate. You will work closely with the product team to conceptualize and execute on designs to solve problems for our products. This is a very rare opportunity that will put you in the position of total ownership of whole product from design perspective without the risk of starting your own company. Every designer at Hive has responsibility of a whole product, although we encourage the team to provide feedback to each other.
You are a talented designer who consistently delivers visuals and interactions of highest quality on timelines that would be unrealistic for many others. You take pride in your creative vision, execution and communication skills. You are a strong individual contributor, but also a team player. You enjoy taking ownership of full products, and are stifled by large design organizations.
You get a rush from seeing your designs live in the real world.
Responsibilities
Lead design projects across the entire product lifecycle and multiple product launches
Work with small multi-disciplinary teams. You’ll partner closely with engineering, product, and business folks to find elegant but practical solutions to design challenges
Be autonomous. You’ll take full ownership of your work, and you take responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way
Rapidly produce multiple concepts and prototypes; knowing when to apply pixel-perfect attention to detail, and when to make low-fi sketches and prototypes
Requirements
1+ year of experience designing consumer and mobile products
Had ownership of many consumer products over the years, and understand what it takes to create awesome, consumer-oriented experiences
Highly skilled in using design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, Sketch and/or Invision
Biased toward action and execution. You get nervous if you’re not sketching concepts, tweaking flows or polishing the designs that represent the big-thinking work
Great communication skills that help you work with product and engineering to make product visions come to life
Constantly looking to hone your design instinct through user feedback. Whether through hands-on user research, or by designing options for an A / B test
You have an online portfolio or PDF that you can share with us
Nice to Have
Work experience at a leading consumer technology company like Uber, Airbnb, Houzz, Square etc.
Who We Are
We are a group of ambitious individuals who are passionate about creating a revolutionary AI company. At Hive, you will have a steep learning curve and an opportunity to contribute to one of the fastest growing AI start-ups in San Francisco. The work you do here will have a noticeable and direct impact on the development of the company. Thank you for your interest in Hive and we hope to meet you soon!"

Cash App is the fastest growing financial brand in the world. Built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic money app with over 36 million active monthly users.
Loved by customers and by pop culture, we’ve held the #1 spot in finance on the App Store for almost two years, and our social media posts see more engagement in a day than most financial brands see in a year.
With major offices in San Francisco, New York, St. Louis, Portland, Kitchener-Waterloo, Toronto and Melbourne, Cash App is bringing a better way to send, spend, and save to anyone who has ever sought an alternative to today’s banking system.

Job Description

Our team is continuing to grow and we’re looking for Engineers with experience developing ML pipelines and infrastructure to join us and build out the next generation platform to power use cases across the company. Across the team, we employ methods ranging from simple heuristics to Deep Learning technology to improve our performance and services. We’re also excited to explore new directions with the team to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.
Our ML Engineers operate embedded in product-focused Workstreams and work in close collaboration with Data Scientists, ML Modelers and Software Engineers from across Cash App. Here are some Workstreams that are currently growing:
Identity
The ML Identity team focuses on providing AI-based opportunities to establish and verify Cash App's customer identities across the services we provide. This team works to build out both security and accessibility for Cash App users. We're a small team of engineers focused on exploring AI longshots, balancing a passion for advancing what's possible with a commitment to positive real-world impact.

In addition, we are continually evolving our platform to scale up in line with Cash App’s global expansion, and to provide the rapid payments platform that our customers expect and demand.
Banking
The Banking ML team focuses on all things ML related to the Cash Card and Banking at Cash. There is an element of risk and fraud prevention involved. From building pipelines and models to combat fraud on every Cash Card transaction and activation, to building out data models and pipelines to enable a large expansion of Cash Check Deposits. We are a new team that was created to support the fast growing banking space within Cash App. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that our customers experience safe and reliable Banking with Cash App.
Customer Support
The Cash Customer Support ML team has a vision to provide customer support that’s better than humans through ML. We’re a mixed team of engineers and modellers that work together to deliver models that help us support our customers when they run into problems. We currently use ML automation on two support channels: email and in-app chat. We’re actively working towards making these perform better and we’re always looking for innovative solutions to help our customers with ML.
Problems you’d work on:
Design elegant ML pipelines and services as well as prototype new approaches and productionize solutions at scale for our 36+ million active users
Create a world class platform for training, hosting and maintaining ML models
Apply ML and engineering best practices to shape how Cash App develops, tests and maintains ML-platform solutions
Help design and execute our long-term Machine Learning strategy across Cash App

3+ years of experience in software development and demonstrated technical initiative and leadership on previous projects
Curiosity and a passion for Cash App's mission of economic empowerment
Experience helping your teammates grow through mentorship and providing constructive feedback
A desire to be hands-on and help invent the future of AI
The ability to work autonomously in the rapidly evolving world of ML
Experience or knowledge in ML is helpful but not a prerequisite: if you are a solid software engineer, then we are happy to train you up in the mysterious ways of ML
Stack:
We value general engineering skill and versatility over existing domain knowledge, but here’s a sample of what we currently use:
Python, Java and Kotlin
Tensorflow and PyTorch
AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes
MySQL, DynamoDB, Kafka, Apache Beam and Google DataFlow

Postdoctoral Fellow: Artificial Intelligence in Drug Develop...,Genentech,"San Francisco, CA (Mission Bay area)+1 location",4.1,None,Posted25 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=b99afaa55763033d&fccid=2525cc4a9a704809&vjs=3,"THE POSITION
We are seeking a talented Computational Scientist to carry out impactful and boundary-pushing research at the intersection of AI and Drug Development. While there have been major advances in the development of AI/ML algorithms, to enable Human-Machine Partnership in the context of Drug Development it is crucial that the models be explainable and generalizable. To this end, new methodologies need to be developed and demonstrated on large, longitudinal clinical datasets.
The AI Postdoctoral Fellow will develop methodologies for generating causal explanations from Neural-ODE models, to help surmount the existing challenges associated with the use of saliency maps on longitudinal data. A second focus revolves around using mechanism-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance the generalizability of neural-ODE models, by leveraging the insight that models built on established mechanistic basis tend to enable better extrapolations. We expect that the research outcome will be published in top tier journals as well as influence the best practices within the drug development industry.
Requirements:
The candidate should possess a PhD in a quantitative discipline (Computer Science/Computational Sciences, Biomedical Informatics, Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, Pharmacometrics, Statistics, and others) and a track record of developing and implementing innovative ideas. Knowledge and/or experience with Neural-ODE, Graph Neural Networks and other Deep Learning architectures for longitudinal data are highly desirable. Experience with Pharmacometrics and Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) models is not required, but would be a plus. Excellent communications skills and a strong publication record are expected.

Team members can work primarily remotely. Starting in 2022, teams will meet in person every quarter in one of Grammarly’s hubs, currently in San Francisco, Vancouver, New York, and Kyiv. To ensure that teams are able to overlap in their working hours and to meet face-to-face when needed, all team members need to live within three time zones of their direct team.
Grammarly team members who will be collaborating at our Vancouver hub must be based in Canada.

The opportunity

Grammarly empowers people to thrive and connect, whenever and wherever they communicate. More than 30 million people and 30,000 teams around the world use our AI-powered writing assistant every day.

Design experiments, including for offline prototypes in a statistically sound way that will provide actionable data and enable us to make reliable decisions as we iterate on a project.
Promote excellence and best practices across the machine learning team in regards to research, implementation, tooling, and system design.
Work cross-functionally across multiple partner teams to get new features shipped across our many interfaces.
We’re looking for someone who
Embodies our EAGER values—is ethical, adaptable, gritty, empathetic, and remarkable.
Understands traditional machine learning algorithms and how to use them effectively in practice.
Is familiar with deep learning and its applications in industry.
Has a strong working knowledge of statistics as it relates to sampling methodologies and designing experiments
Understands data structures and algorithms at a level sufficient to write performant code when working with large datasets or large incoming data streams.
Is aware of NLP techniques to effectively work with very high-dimensional, sparse data.
Has enough experience with academic research to be comfortable reading and implementing papers to reproduce their results.
Support for you, professionally and personally
Professional growth: We hire people we trust, and we give team members autonomy to do their best work. We also support professional development with training, coaching, and regular feedback.
A connected team: Grammarly builds products that help people connect, and we apply this mindset to our own team. We have a highly collaborative culture supported by our EAGER values. We also take time to celebrate our colleagues and accomplishments with global, local, and team-specific events and programs.
Comprehensive benefits: Grammarly offers all team members competitive pay along with a benefits package that includes superior health care. We also offer support to set up a home office, ample and defined time off, gym and recreation stipends, admission discounts, and more.
We encourage you to apply

At Grammarly, we value our differences, and we encourage all—especially those whose identities are traditionally underrepresented in tech organizations—to apply. We do not discriminate on the basis of ancestry, race, place of origin, political belief, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, or any other characteristic protected by law.

UI / UX Designer Role
You’ll be expected to own your space: work with all disciplines on your team to build, launch and iterate. You will work closely with the product team to conceptualize and execute on designs to solve problems for our products. This is a very rare opportunity that will put you in the position of total ownership of whole product from design perspective without the risk of starting your own company. Every designer at Hive has responsibility of a whole product, although we encourage the team to provide feedback to each other.
You are a talented designer who consistently delivers visuals and interactions of highest quality on timelines that would be unrealistic for many others. You take pride in your creative vision, execution and communication skills. You are a strong individual contributor, but also a team player. You enjoy taking ownership of full products, and are stifled by large design organizations.
You get a rush from seeing your designs live in the real world.
Responsibilities
Lead design projects across the entire product lifecycle and multiple product launches
Work with small multi-disciplinary teams. You’ll partner closely with engineering, product, and business folks to find elegant but practical solutions to design challenges
Be autonomous. You’ll take full ownership of your work, and you take responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way
Rapidly produce multiple concepts and prototypes; knowing when to apply pixel-perfect attention to detail, and when to make low-fi sketches and prototypes

Had ownership of many consumer products over the years, and understand what it takes to create awesome, consumer-oriented experiences
Highly skilled in using design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, Sketch and/or Invision
Biased toward action and execution. You get nervous if you’re not sketching concepts, tweaking flows or polishing the designs that represent the big-thinking work
Great communication skills that help you work with product and engineering to make product visions come to life
Constantly looking to hone your design instinct through user feedback. Whether through hands-on user research, or by designing options for an A / B test
You have an online portfolio or PDF that you can share with us

Work experience at a leading consumer technology company like Uber, Airbnb, Houzz, Square etc.

DNA sequence variations are linked to disease via changes in the nature and abundance of protein and RNA gene products. The Sequence Learning group builds models directly from DNA/RNA sequence in addition to other data sources such as chromatin state. Models that operate on a sequence level can infer changes in protein/RNA states and the associated cellular function from sequence alone. This is an exciting methodological advance at the intersection of NLP inspired language models applied to biological data.
We're looking for a highly accomplished AI/ML Engineer to join our team. Competitive candidates will have a track record of shipping high performing AI/ML powered products in production environments. They are highly accomplished Machine Learning Engineers, with breadth across Machine Learning Methods, as well as depth in at least one area. Additionally, they are accomplished software engineers with a track record of shipping stable, tested, performant code and services in an agile environment.
Strong candidates will have graduate studies in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, or the equivalent, and a passion for solving challenging problems in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Educational or professional background in the biological sciences is a plus; passion to help therapies for new and existing diseases, and a pattern of continuous learning and development is mandatory.
The AI/ML team is built on the principles of ownership, accountability, continuous development, and collaboration. We hire for the long term, and we're motivated to make this a great place to work. Our leaders will be committed to your career and development from day one.

BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITY
Legion is seeking world class talent to help us capitalize on a massive opportunity to enable the future of work for the 2.7 billion-person strong deskless workforce. We have built a cutting edge workforce engagement suite which leverages AI and machine learning to deliver labor efficiency for employers and great experiences for employees across the Retail, Hospitality, and Fitness industries. Legion is backed by preeminent venture firms such as Norwest Venture Partners, First Round Capital, and XYZ Ventures and is based in Redwood City, California.

The hourly workforce currently constitutes almost 60% of the overall labor market in the United States and these nearly 80 million hourly workers are the driving force behind many of our largest domestic industries like food/beverage, retail and hospitality. Management of this workforce has historically been difficult due to high churn (average of 60%), high cost of replacement (average of $3,200 per employee in retail) and now new challenges are developing as millennials enter this market. The retail vertical alone spends $62 billion dollars a year on replacing workers and over 50% of hourly workers leave their jobs because of flexibility reasons.

In our modern, Uber-ized times, younger folks seek gig-like flexibility, modern mobile first technology and compelling work options. They want to use an app on their phone to schedule work, not haggle with the manager over their schedule on a week to week basis. Likewise, employers are increasingly in need of a flexible and efficient labor model that supports the innovations (think pop up stores, home delivery, mobile ordering, service options etc) needed, and frankly demanded, by today's modern customers. Mid market organizations have never had a technology platform to manage their hourly workers and the enterprise is mired in decades old technology (think Kronos, Infor) that's both user unfriendly and wildly ineffective for managing today's modern hourly workforce. There is a huge opportunity to modernize and upgrade how hourly workers interact with their employers and while enabling employers to be elastic, efficient and innovative...but no one has cracked the code until now.

ENTER LEGION
Legion's mission is to build the platform that enables this transition. We have built a workforce engagement solution that applies AI and machine learning to accurately forecast demand and automatically match employees to work. The simple notion of matching work that needs to be done to the best suited employee who wants it and doing so in a fair, compliant and efficient manner is fundamental to today's new job economy. The Legion platform provides flexible, efficient ways for employers and employees to engage with each other and enable the future of work.

At its core, this is a supply versus demand issue. Legion is able to use advanced machine learning to accurately predict how much work needs to be done and by what roles and skills. These forecasts are fully automated and tailored to the unique attributes of every location and take into account factors that impact customer traffic. For instance, rain could decrease customer traffic at an outdoor cafe but would likely increase the volume of delivery orders. Legion now helps you predictably staff for these events, and it gets more and more accurate as it ingests more data. Legion then uses AI to automatically match these forecasts to the best employees based on a wide variety of factors such as employee preference, skill, productivity and labor compliance policies. Likewise all of these rules are easily customizable to a unique business, policies and best practices of every customer. Legion is able to make informed and practical autonomous business decisions for every customer with the simple push of a button.
Legion is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, national origin, veteran, disability status, or any other basis covered by appropriate law.

"Software Engineer, Content",Nylas,"San Francisco, CA 94103 (South of Market area)",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=93636ea771bea0e6&fccid=c73f42ea32794290&vjs=3,"Nylas is a pioneer and leading provider of productivity infrastructure solutions for modern software. Over 80,000 developers worldwide use the Nylas platform to quickly and securely build productivity features into their applications. With Nylas, developers get unprecedented access to rich communications data from their end-users, pre-built workflows that automate everyday tasks, embeddable UI/UX components for fast front-end development, and comprehensive security features - all delivered via a suite of powerful APIs that make integration easy.

Who We Are

Nylas was founded in 2013 and has raised over $175M to date from Tiger Global, 8VC, Spark Capital, Slack, and more; as well as individual investors including Patrick Collison, Co-Founder and CEO of Stripe, John Collison, President and Co-Founder of Stripe, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of Klarna, and Tony Fadell. Developers around the world use Nylas to quickly and securely build email, scheduling, and work automation features into their applications. Nylas customers include Upwork, Wix, Freshworks, Lever, Dialpad, Ceridian, and Move.com.

Our Work Philosophy

Nylas is also a big believer in the safety and well-being of our employees and society, which is why we are onboarding all new Nylanauts remotely during this global pandemic until there is a vaccine and it is safe for humans to resume their pre-COVID lifestyles.

AND once COVID-19 pandemic eventually comes to an end, we will continue to embrace Remote First philosophy, with a minor twist: Remote First, Office Second. That's right! It's about how you work, not where you work. Nylanauts can choose any workspace or environment that will result in more ideas, engagement, creativity, focus, collaboration, and productivity. It's true. They can go anywhere as long as they respect the working hours (time zones) of their team. Wherever motivates them; inspires them to be better versions of themselves. This means Nylanauts can work from the slopes of Missoula before traveling to the beaches of San Diego. Wonderful!

And if Nylanauts want to work from an office in one of our hubs (San Francisco, Denver, New York City, Toronto, and London), they can. Go ahead! The workspace is there to be utilized.
Why Remote First, Office Second? Because we not only believe in respecting individual working styles, disabilities, and personal schedules, but also ensuring everyone has a better work-life balance. The outcomes will always be more important than the physical location.

So, if you’re looking to join a fast-growing company with a beloved, daily-use product, and an authentic mission that puts people first, we want to meet you. Want to know more? Check us out on Comparably and Great Place to Work!

Position description
The Pantas and Ting Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology (SCET) at the University of California, Berkeley invites applications for a pool of qualified temporary, part-time instructors to teach experiential-based courses in SCET, housed within the Industrial Engineering and Operations Research department, should an opening arise. Screening of applicants is ongoing and will continue as needed. The number of positions varies from semester to semester (Spring, Summer and Fall) depending on the needs of the department. Positions may range from 11% to 100% time in a given semester. Courses are expected to be taught on the UC Berkeley Campus unless instruction remains remote as a result of public health concerns. Instruction for Spring 2021 is expected to be primarily remote.
UC Berkeley's SCET is the premier institution for the study and practice of entrepreneurship and technology innovation. SCET’s mission is to empower innovators to positively change the world and believe mindsets and behaviors matter, diversity adds value, and innovators should be responsible for what they create. Since 2005, SCET has created the foundation of Berkeley’s entrepreneurship ecosystem and is known for developing the Berkeley Method, an internationally recognized approach to teaching technology entrepreneurship to undergraduate students, innovation to graduate students, and technology firm leadership to executives and professionals. SCET is where aspiring entrepreneurs and innovators take a deep dive into the world of entrepreneurship and technology innovation. SCET courses offer students the opportunity to learn from experts in their fields, as well as their classmates, and address real-world problems through hands-on group projects. Students have the chance to build networks, learn how to start and grow their own start up, and strengthen transferrable skills in areas such as leadership, teamwork, and communication. The mindsets and skills introduced in SCET classes prepare students to become innovative leaders in their industry, jobs or ventures regardless of the field.
SCET hires a number of qualified professionals and academics to hold temporary, part-time lecturer appointments to lend variety and subject matter expertise to our core topics. The topics in our Fall, Spring and Summer curriculum may include but are not limited to: Technology Firm Leadership, Technology Entrepreneurship, Social/Sustainable Entrepreneurship, Product Management, Data Science, and other topics in entrepreneurship and technology innovation. Challenge and Project-based courses may include, but are not limited to, topics such as Alternative Meat, Blockchain, 5G/Mobile, Artificial Intelligence and other emerging technologies and industries.
SCET hires for both lecturer and Teacher Special Program (TSP) positions. TSPs teach short courses on one or more of the topic areas listed. Most TSP courses are taught in a ‘bootcamp’ format in August and January. Lecturers may be appointed for a semester or for the academic year, depending on instructional assignments. Lecturers and TSPs are responsible for the course syllabus, curriculum development and delivery, holding office hours, student assessment through relevant projects, presentations, problem sets, exams, and/or class attendance and participation, and assigning grades.
Basic qualifications: Bachelor's or equivalent international degree required at the time of application.
Additional qualifications: By the start of the appointment, advanced degree or five years teaching experience and/or five years industry experience.
Preferred qualifications: Experience starting and growing new technology ventures, investing, and/or executive experience.
Salary is based on the candidate's highest degree, college teaching experience, and industry experience. The minimum annual full-time rate is currently $63,788.
The Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship & Technology seeks candidates whose teaching and experience has prepared them to contribute to our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.
To apply, please go to the following link: https://aprecruit.berkeley.edu/JPF02808
The posting will remain open until December 31, 2021 to accommodate department needs. Appointments for fall and summer semesters are usually reviewed in April, and for spring semester in October. If you wish to remain in the pool after December 31, 2021 you will need to reapply.

Postdoctoral Fellow: Artificial Intelligence in Drug Develop...,Genentech,"San Francisco, CA (Mission Bay area)+1 location",4.1,None,Posted25 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=b99afaa55763033d&fccid=2525cc4a9a704809&vjs=3,"THE POSITION
We are seeking a talented Computational Scientist to carry out impactful and boundary-pushing research at the intersection of AI and Drug Development. While there have been major advances in the development of AI/ML algorithms, to enable Human-Machine Partnership in the context of Drug Development it is crucial that the models be explainable and generalizable. To this end, new methodologies need to be developed and demonstrated on large, longitudinal clinical datasets.
The AI Postdoctoral Fellow will develop methodologies for generating causal explanations from Neural-ODE models, to help surmount the existing challenges associated with the use of saliency maps on longitudinal data. A second focus revolves around using mechanism-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance the generalizability of neural-ODE models, by leveraging the insight that models built on established mechanistic basis tend to enable better extrapolations. We expect that the research outcome will be published in top tier journals as well as influence the best practices within the drug development industry.
Requirements:
The candidate should possess a PhD in a quantitative discipline (Computer Science/Computational Sciences, Biomedical Informatics, Mathematics, Physics, Engineering, Pharmacometrics, Statistics, and others) and a track record of developing and implementing innovative ideas. Knowledge and/or experience with Neural-ODE, Graph Neural Networks and other Deep Learning architectures for longitudinal data are highly desirable. Experience with Pharmacometrics and Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) models is not required, but would be a plus. Excellent communications skills and a strong publication record are expected.

We empower our 160 million strong monthly active user
community to share their opinions, record their lives and make new friends - all within the comfort of their language of choice. Our short video platform Moj, is today India;s preferred short video destination with tens of millions of users from across the world. The platform has been designed for artists and creators to create innovative short video content and display
their creativity to millions, globally. At ShareChat we are spearheading India's internet revolution.
By providing a meaningful social experience, we are determining how the next billion users will interact on the internet.

AI @ ShareChat
If you look closely at the first 100 million Internet users and the rest of the users who came online in the last few years, you will notice stark differences in their needs and wants from
the Internet. While the first generation Internet users in India weren’t too different from Internet users in the rest of the world, the next wave of users are truly unique in a number of
ways. A huge chunk of audience is regional language first audience and therefore wants to consume content and services in their native language. Their taste in content also happens
to be vastly different – we observe a long tail of content genres emerging that didn’t exist previously. Despite the internet growing so swiftly, many Indian Internet users are not
comfortable with searching on the internet or finding whom to follow in order to satisfy their information needs. A radically simplified paradigm for content delivery is needed for this
audience – one that automatically learns the user’s taste and pushes the right content at the right time to them based on their interest. ShareChat harnesses AI in its quest towards this
mission possible.
Feed Intelligence
The core product value of ShareChat revolves around its algorithmically generated content feeds. Our Feed Intelligence team is in charge of ensuring all feeds in the ShareChat app
remain highly engaging for our users at all times, optimising multiple objectives of relevance, freshness, diversity and so on. The team is working to find answers to a number of
interesting research questions. Examples include: How do we adapt the mix of content in feeds to optimize for long term user engagement? How to effectively explore users’ preferences over a long tail of content genres where their tastes are highly dynamic?

Content Intelligence
Our Content Intelligence team is focused on developing models that can accurately make sense of posts so that they can be served to a relevant audience. We are investigating
different approaches to create unified multimodal representations for a post that capture visual (from images or video), audio and text data from the post. Such a representation for a
post should precisely predict how our users interpret the post and what they feel about it.
Camera Intelligence
Our Camera Intelligence team builds unique capabilities in the ShareChat camera to help
our users create engaging, original content on our platform. They focus on efficient
implementations of capabilities in Computer Vision (e.g., semantic segmentation, super
resolution) and Speech Processing so that they can run on mid to low end smartphones. Our
mission is to enable every creator, across the long tail of content genres, to unleash the
superpowers of AI and be able to create professional grade content.

BACKGROUND AND OPPORTUNITY
Legion is seeking world class talent to help us capitalize on a massive opportunity to enable the future of work for the 2.7 billion-person strong deskless workforce. We have built a cutting edge workforce engagement suite which leverages AI and machine learning to deliver labor efficiency for employers and great experiences for employees across the Retail, Hospitality, and Fitness industries. Legion is backed by preeminent venture firms such as Norwest Venture Partners, First Round Capital, and XYZ Ventures and is based in Redwood City, California.

The hourly workforce currently constitutes almost 60% of the overall labor market in the United States and these nearly 80 million hourly workers are the driving force behind many of our largest domestic industries like food/beverage, retail and hospitality. Management of this workforce has historically been difficult due to high churn (average of 60%), high cost of replacement (average of $3,200 per employee in retail) and now new challenges are developing as millennials enter this market. The retail vertical alone spends $62 billion dollars a year on replacing workers and over 50% of hourly workers leave their jobs because of flexibility reasons.

In our modern, Uber-ized times, younger folks seek gig-like flexibility, modern mobile first technology and compelling work options. They want to use an app on their phone to schedule work, not haggle with the manager over their schedule on a week to week basis. Likewise, employers are increasingly in need of a flexible and efficient labor model that supports the innovations (think pop up stores, home delivery, mobile ordering, service options etc) needed, and frankly demanded, by today's modern customers. Mid market organizations have never had a technology platform to manage their hourly workers and the enterprise is mired in decades old technology (think Kronos, Infor) that's both user unfriendly and wildly ineffective for managing today's modern hourly workforce. There is a huge opportunity to modernize and upgrade how hourly workers interact with their employers and while enabling employers to be elastic, efficient and innovative...but no one has cracked the code until now.

ENTER LEGION
Legion's mission is to build the platform that enables this transition. We have built a workforce engagement solution that applies AI and machine learning to accurately forecast demand and automatically match employees to work. The simple notion of matching work that needs to be done to the best suited employee who wants it and doing so in a fair, compliant and efficient manner is fundamental to today's new job economy. The Legion platform provides flexible, efficient ways for employers and employees to engage with each other and enable the future of work.

At its core, this is a supply versus demand issue. Legion is able to use advanced machine learning to accurately predict how much work needs to be done and by what roles and skills. These forecasts are fully automated and tailored to the unique attributes of every location and take into account factors that impact customer traffic. For instance, rain could decrease customer traffic at an outdoor cafe but would likely increase the volume of delivery orders. Legion now helps you predictably staff for these events, and it gets more and more accurate as it ingests more data. Legion then uses AI to automatically match these forecasts to the best employees based on a wide variety of factors such as employee preference, skill, productivity and labor compliance policies. Likewise all of these rules are easily customizable to a unique business, policies and best practices of every customer. Legion is able to make informed and practical autonomous business decisions for every customer with the simple push of a button.
Legion is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, national origin, veteran, disability status, or any other basis covered by appropriate law.

The Opportunity
Machine Learning is a critical part of Adobe’s Cloud offering. Adobe Clouds enable customers to build and manage digital content, such as assets, composites, 3D, documents etc., and digital experience and transformations.
Creative Cloud is focused on visual imagination and creation, and includes such well-known products as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Adobe Stock. Document Cloud is centered around the creation and management of textual documents, including Acrobat and Adobe Sign. Experience Cloud is the set of offerings for the large-scale enterprise, covering marketing, advertising, and analytics.
Adobe Sensei powers machine learning and artificial intelligence across all of these Adobe Cloud product lines. This platform enables thousands of applied researchers, millions of users, and billions of content pieces. The objective is to make machine learning offerings a world-class, leading-edge, differentiating product in Adobe Cloud ecosystem. We match the pace, innovation and excitement of a startup, backed by the resources and infrastructure of Adobe!
Data is critical piece of developing machine learning solutions. ML data can include the datasets that train algorithms, but also large-scale evaluation datasets which give insights into algorithm behavior that helps to refine and evolve ML products.
Training data – Adobe’s training datasets often contain digital art, photos, videos, text, or audio files, along with some type of additional knowledge data (user behaviors, annotations, manipulations) to enable meaningful machine learning. How do we build these datasets to maximize performance and accuracy for the customer? How do we ensure that our models are robust and unbiased?
Evaluation - How do we assess the quality of our algorithms and models? What is the ground truth we use to judge them? Where do they succeed and how do they fail? These problems are even more subtle in the complex, creative domains of Adobe products – for example, how should we judge the quality of similarity search, where a user finds new images with an image as the query?
We’re looking for data scientists to define, drive, and coordinate training data construction and model evaluation for the Applied Machine Learning team at Adobe. This will involve thinking hard about product quality, the role of machine learning in those products, and the capabilities of large-scale human-judgment tasks to support scalable solutions that generate the fuel for success of our AI/ML algorithms.
Responsibilities:
Work closely with product, research, and engineering leaders to understand ML applications and define success.
Interact with APIs to effectively sample raw data to optimize for ML training and evaluation.
Design tasks and guidelines for human judgment jobs to annotate images, videos, text, audio; and also to measure the performance of machine-learned and other advanced algorithms.
Help design A/B tests for our cloud offerings, and use human judgment vs. end-user A/B tests as appropriate
Create a winning culture built on collaboration and shared accomplishments- have fun along the way!
Qualifications:
BS or MS in a technical field (Computer Science, Physics, Math, Statistics) OR in a human-centered field such as Psychology, Linguistics, Human-Computer Interaction.
Exposure to applied machine learning in an enterprise setting.
Proven experience in validation and evaluation of machine learned models.
Strong quantitative and analytical orientation. Experience in evaluation metrics, Python or R, JSON parsing, custom HTML for visualization.
Strong qualitative skillset. Experience in taxonomies, survey design.
Understanding of issues around ground truth and training/evaluation data for ML, including human judgment and A/B testing
Hands-on experience using third-party judgment services such as Figure 8, Appen, or Amazon Mechanical Turk.
At Adobe, you will be immersed in an exceptional work environment that is recognized throughout the world on Best Companies lists. You will also be surrounded by colleagues who are committed to helping each other grow through our unique Check-In approach where ongoing feedback flows freely.
If you’re looking to make an impact, Adobe's the place for you. Discover what our employees are saying about their career experiences on the Adobe Life blog and explore the meaningful benefits we offer.
Adobe is an equal opportunity employer. We welcome and encourage diversity in the workplace regardless of gender, race or color, ethnicity or national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or veteran status."

The team is comprised of a rare group of high-caliber former founders and startup operators, working within Amazon to drive AWS strategy and support the next generation of entrepreneurs.

Candidates must have a background as a startup founder or investor, where they’ve built a business, raised capital, and experienced the arc of business-building from nothing to something.

The candidate must have demonstrated the ability to think strategically about business, product, and technical challenges, convey compelling data-driven decisions, and work collaboratively to build consensus.

A keen sense of ownership, drive, and scrappiness is a must, as is the ability to leverage and motivate Amazon and AWS’s global organization to achieve results:

Serve as a key member of the Business Development team in helping drive overall AWS market and technical strategy.
Work closely with startup organizations and portfolio companies to ensure they are successful using the AWS platform, by providing technical resources and business mentorship.

We are looking for an experienced Product Manager to lead optimization of our Search & Recommendations systems. You will be responsible for working with Data Science, Engineering, and Design to develop a roadmap for solving problems like:
Search Intent - When a user searches for “DiGiorno's pizza”, how might we fix any misspellings? What is a brand? What is the category? How can we show a result set that is 100% relevant to what the user’s intent is? What happens when we don’t understand the user’s intent?
Results Ranking - How might we put products that we know users want to buy at the top of the page? How do we know when we’ve done a good job?
Recommendations - What products are similar to what I’m looking for? What are products that I might buy alongside the product I’m interested in? How can we predict & show the next item that you’re going to buy?
Personalization - How might we make our search results or substitution recommendations relevant based on what matters to a user? How might we provide relevant results to someone with specific dietary preferences?
Universal search - How might we facilitate product searches across multiple stores?
In this role you will also interact very closely with the product catalog and product availability teams to diagnose whether customer issues are due to our search systems or whether they are related to our product catalog.

Chief of Staff,Clarify Health Solutions.,"San Francisco, CA",None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=ce08f845efc648ea&fccid=a43657d8af5c59dd&vjs=3,"Company Overview

Our mission is to empower the delivery of better care and therapies through actionable insights.

Healthcare is challenging. Too often, we and those we love fail to receive the care we deserve due to delayed, impersonal, incomplete or hard-to-understand information. Economists estimated that up to 20-30% of healthcare spending fails to meaningfully move outcomes and is wasted. In the US alone, this adds up to nearly $1 trillion per year that could be re-directed to additional access to care, new roads, and better schools.

One of the biggest drivers of this confusion and waste is a lack of easily accessible, timely and personalized information on how to optimize each and every healthcare journey.

We believe we can change healthcare by deliberately bringing together healthcare experience, Silicon Valley big data software engineering, and cutting-edge data science to deliver innovative solutions to pervasive problems.

Clarify Health is a rapidly growing technology company whose enterprise analytics cloud transforms healthcare data into actionable insights for providers, health plans, and life sciences companies. Our Insights Platform powers highly automated business applications that enable customers to drive growth, optimize networks, improve care delivery, manage population health, maximize value-based care performance, and commercialize pharmaceutical and biotechnology products. We are proud to be redefining the science behind understanding and predicting individual patient journeys and cohorts. With intuitive, on-demand interrogation of over 300 million longitudinal patient journeys, Clarify enables healthcare organizations to leapfrog from traditionally cumbersome and manual analytics, unlocking self-service and rapid generation of insights that result in better health and outcomes

Clarify Health brings together committed and passionate colleagues with backgrounds in big data and AI engineering from financial services together with extensive clinical operations expertise. The team has a track record of achieving over $1 billion in improvement at more than 125 health systems, payers, and pharmaceutical companies, and deploying cloud-based software at over 5,000 institutions.

Simulation is building a platform to accelerate the development and testing of the entire AV technology stack for both hardware and software. We collaborate with teams like AV engineering, systems, and testing to deliver the tools that accelerate development and validation in order to quickly and safely launch new AV capabilities.
Achieving large-scale, commercial AV deployments fundamentally relies on having a powerful and accurate simulation that can test and verify AV behavior across a multitude of virtual driving scenarios without relying on extensive real-world testing and data collection. Developing truly driverless vehicles for ride-hail and goods delivery means Cruise will increasingly rely on Simulation for not just test and validation but also to uncover challenging driving scenarios that will accelerate the development of core AV technologies like Perception and Motion Planning. We're at the forefront of AV technology development and serve as the biggest lever to transform AVs from a prototype into a real commercial product.
