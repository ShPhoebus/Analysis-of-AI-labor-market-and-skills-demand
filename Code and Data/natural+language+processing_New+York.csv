Content and Media Relations Manager,RELX,"New York, NY",3.7,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=564e759d7a3b35a0&fccid=06206ab329e0eb22&vjs=3,"About the Company:
RELX is a global provider of information-based analytics and decision tools for professional and business customers.
We help scientists make new discoveries, doctors and nurses improve the lives of patients and lawyers win cases. We prevent online fraud and money laundering, and help insurance companies evaluate and predict risk. Our events enable customers to learn about markets, source products and complete transactions.
In short, we enable our customers to make better decisions, get better results and be more productive.
The group serves customers in more than 180 geographies and has offices in about 40 countries. It employs over 33,000 people, of whom almost half are in North America. The headquarters is in London. The market capitalization is about £37bn ($52bn), making it one of the 15 largest listed companies in the UK. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange, Euronext and NYSE.
The company has four market segments. It develops information-based analytics and decision tools for professional and business customers in the Scientific, Technical & Medical, Risk & Business Analytics, Legal and Exhibitions sectors.
About the Role:
RELX’s external reputation has been transformed over the past nine years. The corporate communications team has successfully influenced key stakeholders about the transformation of the business, so that the media in the UK and the Netherlands no longer views the company as a publisher but as a successful, innovative, global information-based analytics business.
The company uses an external public relations agency in New York to deliver core messages to US media. The strategy is to aim for what we call The Street, the Hill and The Valley – financial media in New York, journalists based in Washington DC, and technology correspondents in the Bay Area. The core messaging has remained the same for a number of years, namely: RELX’s business success; and the reasons for that success – the strength of its leadership and strategy, innovation, benefits of RELX’s products services for customers, that it is an employer of choice, and that it is a world leader in its Environmental, Social and Governance performance.
RELX’s media profile in the US remains low. Although RELX generates a large proportion of revenues in North America and employs many staff there, it is a challenge to promote a mid-sized UK-based business to business company to American journalists. Nonetheless, we believe we do have compelling stories that could appeal to US media. To address this issue, we are planning to hire a New York-based content and media relations manager.
The role will have two main priorities:
The first priority will be earned media, whether print, broadcast (radio and television) and online. The successful candidate will work with the US agency to build relationships with journalists likely to cover the company; collaborate with the businesses to identify content that might appeal to them; and finally to deliver our core messaging through these media. RELX has a strong story to tell. It has outperformed the FTSE100 for 10 consecutive years, the only company to do this. It provides hugely valuable tools and analytics to a wide range of customers. And it deploys cutting edge machine learning and natural language processing, among other artificial technologies, to make a difference for its clients. Desired content includes earned media articles and stories as well as thought leadership by-lined articles by senior executives within the company.
The second priority will be owned media. RELX is running a multi award-winning owned campaign using cutting edge parallax story-telling technology. The stories can be viewed here: https://www.relx.com/our-business/our-stories . The Content and Media Relations Manager will work with the Head of Content and Media Relations based in London to manage a program of North American owned media content aimed at delivering our messaging to targeted audiences. They will also liaise with the team’s social media manager, based in Washington DC, to successfully amplify that content on social media. Many of the stories lie within the businesses, and the Content and Media Relations Manager will need to co-ordinate with the communications and marketing leads within those operations, as well as work with key internal stakeholders such as the government affairs, corporate responsibility and investor relations teams to identify required content. S/he will also need to manage a portfolio of freelance writers to deliver the copy and then oversee a sometimes, complex approvals process. The Content and Media Relations Manager will also work with the Head of Content and Media Relations on developing the recently launched Unique Contributions podcast.
Working closely with the Head of Content and Media Relations, the key responsibilities of the Content and Media Relations Manager will be:
US media relations
Develop a proactive “earned” media campaign with US media, delivering our core messaging in New York, Washington DC and the Bay Area, as well as national broadcast media, and selective geographies where we have substantial operations. Execute that plan, with the help of our US PR agency, while measuring success of the campaign against agreed objectives.
As required provide help and support for reactive media engagement.
Content Strategy Development
Develop a compelling, holistic “owned” media content strategy for RELX in north America, delivering the company’s core messaging for key external stakeholders, including potential employees, politicians and policy makers, media and customers.
Creative Content Generation
Work with the businesses and corporate teams to identify the best content that will deliver RELX’s core messages to its audiences. Consider a range of formats and channels to maximize the contents’ impact.
Work with the businesses and RELX HQ in London to generate high-quality, creative and impactful content; manage the approvals process with customers and internal stakeholders; work with the social media manager to maximize impact.
Measurement
Identify the best way to measure earned media campaigns and report regularly to the head of content and media relations and head of corporate communications on progress.

"Senior Machine Learning Engineer (Modeling), Cash App",Cash App,"New York, NY",None,None,Posted29 days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=5aa6c8fb839b33f5&fccid=1d1183334521a869&vjs=3,"Company Description
Cash App is the fastest growing financial brand in the world. Initially built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic app with over 36 million monthly active users. We are bringing a better way to send, spend, invest, and save to anyone who has ever sought an alternative to the traditional banking system.

Loved by customers and pop culture, we’ve consistently held the top spot for finance in the App Store for many years, seeing more engagement with millions of followers across social media in a day than most brands see in a year. We are building an ecosystem to redefine the world’s relationship with money by making it universally accessible.

We want to hire the best talent regardless of location. Our employment model is distributed, offering the opportunity to collaborate with teams across the world in San Francisco, New York, St. Louis, Portland, Toronto, Kitchener-Waterloo, Sydney, and Melbourne.

Job Description
Machine Learning is an integral part of how we design products, operate, and pursue Cash App’s mission to serve the unbanked as well as disrupt traditional financial institutions. Our massive scale and deep trove of transaction data create an endless number of opportunities to use artificial intelligence to better understand our customers and offer new products and experiences that can improve their lives. We are a highly creative group that prefers to solve problems from first principles; we move quickly, make incremental changes, and deploy to production every day.
This role is part of our Cash App's ML team and will be deeply embedded within one of our product teams - here are the workstreams we're currently hiring for:
Identity
A customer’s identity is the gateway for unlocking products, features, and higher limits in Cash App’s ever expanding ecosystem. With identity theft and fraud globally on the rise, it is becoming more and more important that financial companies like Cash App build confidence in who a customer says they are, especially when 100% of customer activity is done digitally. As part of the Identity Machine Learning team, you will work cross-functionally on analytical and ML solutions that help us build that confidence and trust in our customer base. Our goal is to reduce the friction good customers have throughout our onboarding and identity verification process while making it harder for bad actors to fake and/or steal someone else’s identity. Accomplishing this upstream before a customer ever takes a transaction means we can completely avoid any downstream fraud, good customer frustration, and/or work other teams have to deal with due to stolen identities.
Risk
You'll build machine learning models that detect fraudulent activity in real time and help keep our customers safe and secure. You will experiment with state-of-the-art algorithms to drive down false positives, collaborate on new product features to drive fraud losses down, use any and every dataset at your disposal (including 3rd party data) to engineer new features for risk models, verify customer documents using OCR, and use biometric and device signals to detect malicious logins and account takeovers.
Search & Discovery
Cash App enables millions of people and businesses to pay and get paid with ease. On our team, we build delightful experiences that help our customers find and discover people and things quickly and with trust - we aim to grow and strengthen the connections between people and businesses across the globe. Through your work, you will empower Cash App to personalize customers’ search and discovery experiences using AI/ML, to better understand our customers’ payment journeys, and help identify and execute on new opportunities for product improvement. You will employ a variety of modeling techniques on our comprehensive customer data and scale your solution to production by partnering closely with design, product, analytics, and engineering teams.
Banking
Working closely with the Banking Product and Financial Platform teams, you will lead development of analytical and ML solutions that utilize our data to power optimizations across our Cash debit card and bank account products. Your work will aim to increase the customer adoption of banking products, reduce the manual operational load caused by banking features, and grow the overall revenue of Cash Banking as a whole. You'll be required to identify ML opportunities, prioritize your time, and solve complex problems where ML will have a significant impact for both our banking customers and/or the operation teams that support them.
Customer Support Automation
Working closely with our Customer Support team, you will use our vast amounts of data to make experiences seamless for our customers and help us achieve world-class service as Cash App continues its rapid growth. You will build models that anticipate customer issues and deliver proactive in-app suggestions, use NLP to contextualize inquiries and respond instantly with relevant content, develop prioritization algorithms that improve efficiency, and apply the latest research to automate conversations with customers.
Technologies we use (and teach):
Python (NumPy, Pandas, sklearn, xgboost, TensorFlow, keras, etc.)
MySQL, Snowflake, GCP/AWS and Tableau
Java

Qualifications
You have:
3+ years experience with applied Machine Learning or Deep Learning
A graduate degree in Computer Science, AI, ML, Applied Math, Stats, Physics, or a related technical field
Worked with Product, Design, and Engineering to prioritize, scope, design, and deploy ML models
A track record of providing mentorship and technical leadership
An appreciation for the connection between the software you build and the experience it delivers to customers

As one of the world's biggest financial news organizations, we lead the way in covering news including corporate earnings, mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings and other market-moving events. Bloomberg's Breaking News team is fast and innovative, and our mission is to deliver the news to readers as quickly as possible, enabling our audience to stay a step ahead.

As a Breaking News editor you will be the first pair of eyes on any market-moving story from the U.S.; as our Arabic speaker in New York, you will also be monitoring developments in the Mideast region from local-language sources. You will watch the constant flow of information from SEC filings, company websites and global regulatory wires; use strong news judgement to identify what will actually move markets; and relay that information in headlines and dispatches as quickly and as clearly as possible to our clients.

You'll take the lead in covering the quarterly earnings of thousands of companies including heavyweights like Apple, Tesla and Goldman Sachs, using cutting-edge tools and automation technology to provide instant context. You will be the first to inform readers of surprise announcements, whether it be Jeff Bezos stepping down as Amazon CEO, a major bank disclosing a hidden charge that may tank the stock, or the FDA approving a Covid vaccine. You will be tasked to clearly distill why a story matters to our terminal clients in a fast-paced environment.

At the same time, you will coordinate with Bloomberg colleagues in Dubai, Riyadh and elsewhere in the Mideast to ensure we're on top of what's happening in that region during U.S. hours. This includes news on companies, the energy industry, and geopolitical events with global repercussions.

Breaking News editors thrive under pressure, aren't afraid to make split-second decisions, and love surprises. When unexpected news breaks, we will jump in to cover it rather than hang back and wait for someone else to take the first step. We work well with both people and technology. We understand what serious market participants are looking for amid the daily deluge of information, and we're adept at separating the wheat from the chaff on social media. If this sounds like you, we want you to join our Breaking News team in North America.

We'll trust you to:

Make fast and decisive judgement calls on breaking news stories, including M&A, IPOs, corporate earnings, government news and other global events
Stay poised and focused in a fast-paced, demanding environment
Unearth news from traditional and new-media sources
Stay on top of major news stories and trends that matter to market participants
Utilize machine-learning tools to ensure Bloomberg remains on the cusp of breaking news
Write market-moving first versions of stories in a matter of minutes, quickly and accurately, explaining why news matters
Collaborate closely with Bloomberg reporters and editors in New York and around the world
Be a constructive, flexible, and dependable team player

You need to have:

Fluency in Arabic
Three to five years of experience covering financial and business news
Proven skill at collaborating and working across teams to accomplish goals
Flexibility with hours and assignments. News is unpredictable!

We""d also love to see:

Experience working in a real-time news environment
Familiarity with the economies and politics of the Mideast region
Familiarity with automation, machine learning and/or natural language processing
Familiarity with social media and ability to evaluate the credibility of information from such sources

If this sounds like you:

Apply today! We're eager to speak with you.

Senior Content Strategist,Code and Theory,New York State•Remote,3.8,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=4ba27915f26abcda&fccid=2cf4169574aa194e&vjs=3,"Senior Content Strategists at Code and Theory help our clients transform their approaches to content planning, development, management, and measurement.

You may be our dream Content Strategist if you:

meticulously organized your toy closet as a kid (Stuffed animals grouped by species? We're looking at you.)
like sleuthing around digital asset and content management systems, configuring site crawls, and building out detailed content inventories
use plain language to explain difficult concepts, and catch yourself writing down definitions of terms when you're not sure everyone agrees on their meaning yet
have just as much fun nerding out with copywriters as you do with data modelers
think the best stories are told in three dimensions

WHAT YOU'LL DO

Through all project stages, you'll closely collaborate with Creative Strategy, Experience Strategy, Engineering, Data, Analytics and Research teams to design and build digital-to-physical ecosystems. These require content to perform complex functions with measurable and optimizable results. Your work with Copywriters, Visual Designers, Developers, and Client-Side product owners ensures the strategic vision is well-executed and expertly managed.

Working with clients at the global enterprise scale means sifting through huge amounts of data and unraveling complex legacy ecosystems. You will help craft methodologies for understanding the current state of content programmatically—crafting meaningful, engaging experiences that resonate to support unique business goals.

ESSENTIALS

We're an open and creative group at Code and Theory. We believe that to be an effective Senior Content Strategist, here are a few essentials:

Senior level experience working in the content strategy, content management, or content marketing space
Organized and skilled at going deep with data (content models, taxonomy schema, and natural language processing), and setting the stage for creative execution teams (page-level architecture, narrative journeys, and editorial planning)
Excited about adapting to the changing landscape and finding creative solutions

WHAT IT TAKES

You will lead our clients to a future of fully connected content experiences—creating new spaces to communicate across touchpoints and environments while also crafting meaningful experiences for people around the world. Dexterity at combining quantitative and qualitative approaches is key. You should be comfortable thinking about the range of content—from its most technical and structural to its most emotional and creative aspects. Organization, positivity and flexibility are essential as you work both autonomously and collaboratively to discover creative solutions.

ABOUT US:

Code and Theory is a strategically driven, digital-first creative agency that lives at the intersection of creativity and technology. We solve consumer and business problems across the entire customer journey that flex to meet the ever-changing needs of consumer expectations. We put the user, their behaviors and needs, at the center of everything we do — from our proprietary research methodologies, to product development processes, to how we create brand, channel and messaging strategies. Our goal is simple: to solve our clients business problems.

We bring big ideas to life by looking holistically at brand ecosystems where digital plays a prominent role in driving the consumer from first-touch through to conversion to relationship deepening over time. We identify gaps in the consumer journey and opportunities in culture that require products, services or communications to fill. We work across categories, ranging as far and wide as health care (Pfizer, Sanofi, Reach MD, Bioreference Laboratories) to financial services (JP Morgan Chase, Prudential, Morgan Stanley, First Data) to cpg (Mars, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson) to technology companies (Facebook, Xerox, Samsung, Comcast) to culture brands (adidas, H&M). And because our DNA is in publishing — we've embedded in over 135 newsrooms in the past decade — we bring unique expertise in understanding how content is created, distributed and optimized, including our work with CNN, NBC News, NBC Sports, and Bustle Digital Group.

At Code and Theory, we strive to only be limited by our own ambition and creativity. We believe in pushing our creativity beyond the easy and obvious answers in order to deliver the solutions that are right for our clients, their businesses, and their consumers.

Code and Theory is an equal opportunity employer, and we value diversity at our company. We don't discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status or disability status."

Cash App is the fastest growing financial brand in the world. Initially built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic app with over 36 million monthly active users. We are bringing a better way to send, spend, invest, and save to anyone who has ever sought an alternative to the traditional banking system.

Loved by customers and pop culture, we’ve consistently held the top spot for finance in the App Store for many years, seeing more engagement with millions of followers across social media in a day than most brands see in a year. We are building an ecosystem to redefine the world’s relationship with money by making it universally accessible.

We want to hire the best talent regardless of location. Our employment model is distributed, offering the opportunity to collaborate with teams across the world in San Francisco, New York, St. Louis, Portland, Toronto, Kitchener-Waterloo, Sydney, and Melbourne.

Job Description
Machine Learning is an integral part of how we design products, operate, and pursue Cash App’s mission to serve the unbanked as well as disrupt traditional financial institutions. Our massive scale and deep trove of transaction data create an endless number of opportunities to use artificial intelligence to better understand our customers and offer new products and experiences that can improve their lives. We are a highly creative group that prefers to solve problems from first principles; we move quickly, make incremental changes, and deploy to production every day.
This role is part of our Cash App's ML team and will be deeply embedded within one of our product teams - here are the workstreams we're currently hiring for:
Identity
A customer’s identity is the gateway for unlocking products, features, and higher limits in Cash App’s ever expanding ecosystem. With identity theft and fraud globally on the rise, it is becoming more and more important that financial companies like Cash App build confidence in who a customer says they are, especially when 100% of customer activity is done digitally. As part of the Identity Machine Learning team, you will work cross-functionally on analytical and ML solutions that help us build that confidence and trust in our customer base. Our goal is to reduce the friction good customers have throughout our onboarding and identity verification process while making it harder for bad actors to fake and/or steal someone else’s identity. Accomplishing this upstream before a customer ever takes a transaction means we can completely avoid any downstream fraud, good customer frustration, and/or work other teams have to deal with due to stolen identities.

At Amazon, we’ve been investing deeply in artificial intelligence for over 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers experience are driven by machine learning. Amazon.com’s recommendations engine is driven by machine learning (ML), as are the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers. Our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are also informed by ML algorithms. Alexa is fueled by Natural Language Understanding and Automated Speech Recognition deep learning; as is Prime Air, and the computer vision technology in our new retail experience, Amazon Go. We have thousands of engineers at Amazon committed to machine learning and deep learning, and it’s a big part of our heritage.

Within AWS, we’re focused on bringing that knowledge and capability to customers through three layers of the AI stack: 1) Frameworks and Infrastructure with tools like Apache MxNet and TensorFlow, 2) Machine Learning Platforms such as Amazon SageMaker for data scientists and 3) API-driven Services like Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Forecast, Amazon Personalize, Amazon Rekognition, Lookout for Equipment, Monitron, Lookout for Metric, Panorama, Lookout for Vision, Health AI, and Amazon Textract to quickly add intelligence to applications with a simple API call.

Develop and support an AWS internal community of AI related subject matter experts.

Inclusive Team Culture
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have twelve employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Work/Life Balance
Our team puts a high value on work-life balance. It isn’t about how many hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We believe striking the right balance between your personal and professional life is critical to life-long happiness and fulfillment. We offer flexibility in working hours and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Join a customer-facing software development team for Structured Finance (one of the most dynamic areas of Fixed Income) supporting our award winning (Chartis RiskTech100® 2021) web product offerings.

We are searching for a Senior Software Developer who will help our team to build new products, re-platform the existing ones, and disrupt the existing market. This is a great opportunity for someone who loves learning, believes in continuous self-improvement, and aspires to lead a team of talented developers to solve hard business problems.


Don't know much about Structured Finance? Don't worry, we will teach you the basics in the first 3-6 months through interactions with our business experts/other team members, attending training sessions, and learning by working on small tasks at the beginning. We expect you to demonstrate curiosity about finance, ask deep questions, and display a continuous drive to learn more about our business.


Here is what you can expect when you join our dynamic team:
In your first 2 months, you'll learn the existing processes and will be amazed at how efficient and innovative our team is with the ELK stack. We strongly believe in the learning-by-doing model. We expect you to assist with various technical business-focused tasks of increased complexity while learning the current infrastructure (SQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Redis/Memcached, PostgresSQL, NodeJS, Scala, Angular, Python, AWS, etc.)

While our developers like to view and work with data in its raw form, our users prefer intuitive eye-pleasing interfaces. We expect you have at least 3 years of full-stack web development experience creating rich user applications with modern frontend frameworks, such as React, Angular, or Vue. Within the first 3 months, you will need to assist in developing our plan to refactor our existing web platform in conjunction with Moody's wide architecture initiatives. This includes the understanding of various use cases, current offerings, and project challenges.

We will count on you to manage the suite of core APIs as a product, balancing foundational work against individual services while prioritizing the backlog. We will evaluate your ability to research, analyze, recommend, and select technical approaches for solving challenging and complex development and integration problems involving API proxies, gateways, authentication, mashups, rate limitations, security, analytics, monetization, SDKs, and developer portals.

Data is one of the most valuable parts of our business, and our team is responsible for moving it around the organization and delivering it to our internal and external clients. We use data movement technologies (ETL/ELT, AWS Glue, Spark, etc.), messaging/Streaming Technologies (AWS SQS, Kinesis/Kafka), Relational and NoSQL databases (Cassandra, Elastic Search, MongoDB, Graph database), API, and in-memory technologies. We require you to have good knowledge of developing and maintaining data pipelines using tools like Apache Spark or other distributed data processing frameworks as well as hands-on experience with Elastic Search. The team expects you to become/serve as a subject matter expert on these technologies. We will evaluate your ability to learn/embrace these tools in the first 3-6 months as well as your contribution to our infrastructure by enhancing it through new features design in the next 6-12 months.

Our team maintains high performance through more independent self-management. We expect you to champion engineering and operational excellence by adhering to best CI/CD practices, code review sessions, post-mortems, and metrics for quality and velocity. We will evaluate your impact by reviewing different metrics around performance, quality, cost, and maintainability.

We work closely with our data, platform, DevOps, and other teams. To be efficient and effective at what we do, our small team relies on effective communication and building trust between the team, our business partners, and other collaborating groups. You will need to build relationships with different stakeholders throughout the development process (project/product managers, business analysts, other developers, financial engineers, etc.)

Innovation and open-mindedness are the key strengths of our team. Our team originates a few POC (proof of concept) projects every year in different areas of Big Data, NLP, Graph DB, multi-threading, distributed computing, and data observability. We are doing this to develop new skills within the team and evaluate if these technologies can improve various aspects of our processes. We would like you to exhibit a desire to learn, participate in POC projects and educate other team members about them.

Our customers and your teammates are counting on you to be present and invested in our success. If you've ever worked in this type of environment, you know the value of teamwork, going-the-extra-mile, and a commitment are to personal success.

Lead Web Developer,DeSales Media Group,"Brooklyn, NY",2.3,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=142924b1f6d7b3cc&fccid=7a1d2208bffeee71&vjs=3,"Lead Web Developer
The Opportunity
The Marketing department at DeSales pushes the envelope of what it means to engage Catholics in their faith. Part digital/creative agency, part brand marketing, and part software services provider, we cover a lot of ground. We manage the websites for 140 different schools, churches, and other Catholic institutions and brands. We run digital campaigns to increase donations for scholarships for education. We live broadcast key events on social to reach those unable to get out of the house. We think differently about what it means to be in the service of our diocese. We don't dwell on the past: we look to the future. And we are excited for the challenge.
Who You Are
As the Lead Web Developer, you bring over five years of industry experience and even more “basement coding” experience to the digital marketing team. You find the development work that marketing agencies do in terms of coding, managing websites, and cyber security to be “child's play.” You've created many beautiful Wordpress websites using custom themes and tweaking themes to match raw wireframes and Photoshop designs. You've built complex web apps. You've built databases and intranets. You build in very fast iterations and live that Agile development life. You understand how to code for the cloud. You aren't afraid to break things you've built, and don't cry over wasted code. You have a repertoire of programming languages (beyond LAMP!) that can meet virtually any need in the digital world. You know the “right” way to code properly with foresight and criticality in mind. You write “dumb code,” thinking of the developer who will have to manage it in the future. You have many seamless best-in-class integrations under your belt, built across multiple platforms, using a mix of paid and open source code. You have strong Google Fu. You don't mind teaching people how to code, but they are going to take and learn your way of doing it as gospel (pun intended). You have your own theories about the future of coding and development in the world economy and would love to give a TED talk about it.
Your Responsibilities
Develop Wordpress websites for internal and external clients from PSD and Wireframes
Quickly produce iterations and mock-ups of web and mobile apps
Manage our HubSpot Database integrations
Work with all of our Brands to produce efficient functionality of websites apps and customizations
Requirements
Proficient in Javascript, C#, Java, Ruby, Python and/or similar languages powering backend services
Proficient knowledge, experience and best practices for Wordpress theme development, and tweaking custom code using PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.
Experience in HubSpot integrations with Wordpress
Understanding of fundamentals around custom modules, hooks, themes, and strong skills with APIs
Strong PHP development and debugging skills.
Familiar with version control and Git.
Familiar with Google Maps API
Can script in Python for automation
Should be able to work independently using creative mocks and requirements to implement and customize/create our Database
Integrate modules after regression testing for incompatibilities and dependencies on other modules already in use.
Performing some system administration tasks (MAMP) to support deployment and maintenance on the server and your own local
NoSQL/MySQL
Experience with Machine Learning (Doc2Vec, autoML NLP etc) preferred
Experience with test driven development, and agile engineering practices including continuous integration

Join a customer-facing software development team for Structured Finance (one of the most dynamic areas of Fixed Income) supporting our award winning (Chartis RiskTech100® 2021) web product offerings.

We are searching for a Senior Software Developer who will help our team to build new products, re-platform the existing ones, and disrupt the existing market. This is a great opportunity for someone who loves learning, believes in continuous self-improvement, and aspires to lead a team of talented developers to solve hard business problems.


Don't know much about Structured Finance? Don't worry, we will teach you the basics in the first 3-6 months through interactions with our business experts/other team members, attending training sessions, and learning by working on small tasks at the beginning. We expect you to demonstrate curiosity about finance, ask deep questions, and display a continuous drive to learn more about our business.


Here is what you can expect when you join our dynamic team:
In your first 2 months, you'll learn the existing processes and will be amazed at how efficient and innovative our team is with the ELK stack. We strongly believe in the learning-by-doing model. We expect you to assist with various technical business-focused tasks of increased complexity while learning the current infrastructure (SQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Redis/Memcached, PostgresSQL, NodeJS, Scala, Angular, Python, AWS, etc.)

While our developers like to view and work with data in its raw form, our users prefer intuitive eye-pleasing interfaces. We expect you have at least 3 years of full-stack web development experience creating rich user applications with modern frontend frameworks, such as React, Angular, or Vue. Within the first 3 months, you will need to assist in developing our plan to refactor our existing web platform in conjunction with Moody's wide architecture initiatives. This includes the understanding of various use cases, current offerings, and project challenges. You will participate in brainstorming sessions with other team leads and help develop the critical paths to success.

Once you demonstrate the ability to juggle multiple tasks across various applications and processes, you will begin to take ownership of larger initiatives and collaborate with other engineers to deliver project epics in the following 6-12 months. We will count on you to manage the suite of core APIs as a product, balancing foundational work against individual services while prioritizing the backlog. We will evaluate your ability to research, analyze, recommend, and select technical approaches for solving challenging and complex development and integration problems involving API proxies, gateways, authentication, mashups, rate limitations, security, analytics, monetization, SDKs, and developer portals.

Data is one of the most valuable parts of our business, and our team is responsible for moving it around the organization and delivering it to our internal and external clients. We use data movement technologies (ETL/ELT, AWS Glue, Spark, etc.), messaging/Streaming Technologies (AWS SQS, Kinesis/Kafka), Relational and NoSQL databases (Cassandra, Elastic Search, MongoDB, Graph database), API, and in-memory technologies. We require you to have good knowledge of developing and maintaining data pipelines using tools like Apache Spark or other distributed data processing frameworks as well as hands-on experience with Elastic Search. The team expects you to become/serve as a subject matter expert on these technologies. We will evaluate your ability to learn/embrace these tools in the first 3-6 months as well as your contribution to our infrastructure by enhancing it through new features design in the next 6-12 months.

Our team maintains high performance through more independent self-management. We expect you to champion engineering and operational excellence by adhering to best CI/CD practices, code review sessions, post-mortems, and metrics for quality and velocity. We will evaluate your impact by reviewing different metrics around performance, quality, cost, and maintainability.

We work closely with our data, platform, DevOps, and other teams. To be efficient and effective at what we do, our small team relies on effective communication and building trust between the team, our business partners, and other collaborating groups. You will need to build relationships with different stakeholders throughout the development process (project/product managers, business analysts, other developers, financial engineers, etc.)

Innovation and open-mindedness are the key strengths of our team. Our team originates a few POC (proof of concept) projects every year in different areas of Big Data, NLP, Graph DB, multi-threading, distributed computing, and data observability. We are doing this to develop new skills within the team and evaluate if these technologies can improve various aspects of our processes. We would like you to exhibit a desire to learn, participate in POC projects and educate other team members about them.

Our customers and your teammates are counting on you to be present and invested in our success. If you've ever worked in this type of environment, you know the value of teamwork, going-the-extra-mile, and a commitment are to personal success.

No amount of education, training, or pedigree will substitute for a willingness to work together, do whatever it takes, and deliver. For the right candidate this role could be permanently remote but preference will be given to those able to move to Buffalo. Working East Coast hours are a must.

Required Qualifications:

Combination of graduate education (MS or PhD) and academic research lab experience in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, or similar computationally intensive degree
2+ yrs of professional ML experience as a technical leader and major contributor on projects with other MLEs and cross-disciplinary contributors involved. Experience in running ML/DL projects from discovery to delivery is highly valued.

Message to Applicants
Syracuse University is an equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law. This nondiscrimination policy covers admissions, employment, and access to and treatment in University programs, services, and activities.

Commitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans

Syracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.

Commitment to a Diverse and Inclusive Campus Community

Syracuse University maintains an inclusive learning environment in which students, faculty, administrators, staff, curriculum, social activities, governance, and all other aspects of campus life reflect a diverse, multi-cultural, and international worldview. The University community recognizes and values the many similarities and differences among individuals and groups. At Syracuse, we are committed to preparing students to understand, live among, appreciate, and work in an inherently diverse country and world made up of people with different ethnic and racial backgrounds, military backgrounds, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, cultural traditions, abilities, sexual orientations and gender identities. To do so, we commit ourselves to promoting a community that celebrates and models the principles of diversity and inclusivity."

Haskell Engineer,Co–Star,New York State•Remote,None,None,Posted30+ days ago,2021-12-04,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=a4383e92b4942da9&fccid=3319b7c4e7bb10f9&vjs=3,"Just four years in, 25% of young women in the US (18-25) have downloaded Co–Star. Our growth has been entirely through word of mouth—we've never spent money on ads. We have millions of active users, raised $21,000,000 from the people behind companies like Twitter, Discord, and Snap, and launched our second paid feature.

For thousands of years, astrology has given people the tools to reflect and connect in real, meaningful ways. Co–Star brings astrology into the 21st century with an app users call their ""best friend"" and therapists recommend to their clients. Astrology is a deterministic system based on the time it takes a planet to orbit the sun. It's more like folk developmental psychology than it is like fortune cookies. Using NASA data interpreted by humans, Co–Star delivers personalized readings in real time. Our AI strings human-written snippets together to generate hyper-personalized interpretations of planetary movements for millions of people.
We're looking for a Haskell Engineer to architect and build our Haskell backend to help tens of millions of people connect to each other and themselves – through astrology – in real, meaningful ways.

What you'll do

Architect and build our Haskell backend with well-documented, easily-tested code that can gracefully scale to tens of millions of users
Build an elegant system that takes the infinite complexity of human language, gives our writers tools for expressive composition, and delivers relevant horoscopes to users using aggregated contextual & historical signals
Use machines to automate a wide variety of repetitive tasks, including some (not all) writing
Work extremely closely with a small, cross-functional team to negotiate, build, and ship new features with the best bang for our buck

What you'll bring

3+ years of hands-on experience writing in Haskell or another functional programming language
An ability to develop, scale, and maintain complex web apps on cloud infrastructure (we use AWS)
A disciplined approach to development, testing, documentation, and code structure in a team environment
Knowledge or a willingness to learn about ML and NLP, particularly libraries like spaCy, GPT-2, and BERT, is a plus

Our technical interview process

Our interview process is divided into four phases — an initial interview with a recruiter, a secondary interview with a manager, 3–4 virtual onsite interviews (1 hour each, 2 of which are technical screens using CoderPad) with peers and cross-functional coworkers, and lastly, a meeting with our founder.
We realize technical interviews can feel challenging to prepare for, so here's what we're interested in seeing from you:

Clean, easily-testable code that's compiled frequently
Clear communication around your decision-making process
Creative and thoughtful problem-solving
Self-reflection around past projects and the ability to articulate what worked, what didn't work, and what you'd do differently now that you know the outcomes
Ability to partner with cross-functional coworkers outside of engineering

We're not interviewing for:

Pure coding skills (we're a cross-functional company and the ability to collaborate across disciplines is equally as important as coding ability)
Memorization of complex algorithms or trivia (we all have access to some form of search engine and use it when we forget)
Your ability to know everything (we may ask you a question you don't know the answer to and that's ok)
""Cracking the Code"" / LeetCode-type knowledge
What we offer
Fully covered $0 deductible healthcare (including therapy, vision, and dental)
401(k)
Unlimited vacation (plus a company-wide two week recharge at the end of each year)
Flexible working hours
Readings with in-house astrologers

Co–Star deeply values diversity. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status, or zodiac sign."

Our growth has been entirely through word of mouth—we've never spent money on ads. We have millions of active users, raised $21,000,000 from the people behind companies like Twitter, Discord, and Snap, and launched our second paid feature.

For thousands of years, astrology has given people the tools to reflect and connect in real, meaningful ways. Co–Star brings astrology into the 21st century with an app users call their ""best friend"" and therapists recommend to their clients. Astrology is a deterministic system based on the time it takes a planet to orbit the sun. It's more like folk developmental psychology than it is like fortune cookies. Using NASA data interpreted by humans, Co–Star delivers personalized readings in real time. Our AI strings human-written snippets together to generate hyper-personalized interpretations of planetary movements for millions of people.
We're looking for an Engineering Manager to manage and develop a creative and skilled team of engineers. You'll help tens of millions of people connect to each other and themselves – through astrology – in real, meaningful ways.

What you'll do

Manage a team of engineers as they architect and build smooth and stable features for the Co–Star apps
Design and support an agile, collaborative development process, from design through test and rollout
Work closely with cross-functional teams to identify opportunities, evaluate tradeoffs, and translate product goals into high quality shippable code
Iterate on processes and structure of the engineering organization
Help define and execute the engineering hiring plan, including sourcing, screening, and interviewing

What you'll bring

4+ years experience managing engineers of varying levels and focus areas (Frontend, Backend, Fullstack, DevOps)
Success around hiring, developing, and retaining engineers, always keeping in mind diversity and inclusion
Precise and thoughtful communication and management style
A mindset that process is around to serve us and is something that can and should be iterated on
A deep appreciation for our intentionally-not-like-other-startups aesthetic ;)
A disciplined approach to development, testing, documentation, and code structure in a team environment

Our stack

Python wrapper intakes NASA data about where the planets are to find the patterns in the night sky from the perspective of earth
Haskell backend transforms data, gives writers superpowers, and delivers resonant, personalized content
BigQuery stores TB of data to create insight for internal teams
Native iOS & Android apps create an incredible mobile experience that feels made-for-your-fingers
AWS infrastructure scales to serve millions of people
What an NLP professor called a ""virtuosic"" use of Google Sheets
We've been taking a full-stack approach to the way we work so far, but want people to own and lead the domains they feel passionate about – whatever they may be
What we offer
Fully covered $0 deductible healthcare (including therapy, vision, and dental)
401(k)
Unlimited vacation (plus a company-wide two week recharge at the end of each year)
Flexible working hours
Readings with in-house astrologers

What You'll Do
You will complete targeted quantitative analyses and build components of advanced models across the spectrum of Risk management, including prospecting, underwriting, portfolio monitoring, pricing, asset evaluation and loss mitigation.
You’ll work on client projects as an integral part of engagement teams and will also be expected to contribute to internal knowledge development initiatives. You’ll disaggregate and structure complex, often ambiguous, business problems and evaluate different analytical approaches to develop potential solutions. You will apply advanced analytic and quantitative tools, statistical modeling techniques, and data mining procedures to derive business insights and solve complex business problems.
Further, you will deploy statistical modeling and optimization techniques most suited for the business problem (using Python, SAS, SQL, R and other relevant tools) to improve Risk management decision making (e.g., underwriting models). You will be expected to contribute to team problem solving through the findings and insights from your analysis and help facilitate data integration and management between clients and McKinsey. Ultimately, you will contribute to the development of knowledge for the analytic group at large.
You will work directly with clients to conduct a hands-on rigorous quantitative analysis, including getting the data, cleaning it, and exploring it for accuracy.
Once data is transformed, you will deploy statistical modeling and optimization techniques most suited for the business problem (using Python, SAS, SQL, R and other relevant tools). You will advise client teams on analytic options to address their specific needs, including discussing potential approaches to problems, associated costs, trade-offs and recommendations. You will interpret outputs of statistical models and results with the team to translate input from quantitative analyses into specific and actionable business recommendations. This includes providing detailed documentation of modeling techniques, methodologies and process steps.
You will balance independent modeling and analytical work with oversight of firm teammates, including fellows and analysts (50/50 balance). You will also advance McKinsey’s overall knowledge base by providing analytical rigor and problem solving to our proprietary knowledge investments, specifically in analytics or the domain area of your expertise.

With the explosion of information and data online, search has never been more important. However, while the world of consumer search has innovated over time, enterprise search has not. In fact, the majority of enterprise search is powered by outdated keyword technology that only scans for keywords and delivers a list of hyperlinks rather than actually answering questions. Yext, the AI Search Company, offers a modern, AI-powered Answers Platform that understands natural language so that when people ask questions about a business online they get direct answers – not links.

We have a big, audacious mission to transform the enterprise with AI search. To achieve that, we need bright minds and diverse perspectives to join our growing company and help us continue to disrupt an industry. Does this sound like you?
As a Data Scientist you will shape how data is collected, transformed, and leveraged to develop essential new capabilities and features for Yext's products.

Our mission revolves around deeply understanding user intent so we can deliver relevant and accurate answers to questions, everywhere people search.

Yext clients cover a tremendous breadth of industries. We are seeking data scientists excited to discover opportunities in data across a wide variety of business domains. You will work collaboratively with cross-team partners in software engineering, product management, and strategy. This approach will allow you to participate fully in the product development lifecycle and make pragmatic decisions about the design, training, and deployment of machine learning models driving key product features.

What You'll Do

Partner with product management and engineering teams throughout the product development lifecycle
Solve ""full stack"" Data Science problems – Implement solutions to a data science problem in a production environment, coping with all the challenges (such as data cleanliness, performance, unexpected feedback loops, and concept drift) that arise
Articulate Data Science and machine learning concepts to a variety of audiences (product managers, software engineers, executives, sales partners)
Dive deep into the details when called for while demonstrating good judgement about when to simplify and prioritize

What You Have

Advanced degree in a quantitative discipline, e.g., computer science, mathematics, business analytics, statistics, applied mathematics, economics, or operations research
Autodidactic, Self directed – You are able to dive into a new unfamiliar problem domain and start learning about it – You are comfortable with uncertainty and project evolution
Effective communicator, a good writer, and know effective means of visually displaying quantitative information
Fluency with data analysis software and tools such as Python and SQL
Exceptional multi-tasking skills

Bonus Points

Experience with JVM languages (Java, Scala) a plus. GoLang or C++ also great!
Experience with AWS, Linux and Mac environments
Excellent ability to cope with ""glue"" problems - shell scripting, debugging python environment problems, fixing broken packages
Knowledge of Python or R, and the machine learning, data processing and visualization packages (e.g. Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
Knowledge of SQL and databases like MySQL, Postgres, Presto and Hive.
Knowledge of neural network packages (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and state-of-the-art transformer/NLP models and techniques (e.g. FastText, BERT, et al.)
