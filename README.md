# Analysis-of-AI-labor-market-and-skills-demand

I conducted an analysis on AI labor market and skills demand, explored the general IT skills and requirements to compare the salary differences in different fields and regions and give career planning opinions for practitioners, and finally applied different machine learning models to predict the market salary level according to the information of job seekers.

We are here to raise two research questions and answer these questions through our analysis of the data searched from
Indeed recruitment websites:

• Research Question 1 (RQ1): In AI field, what skills (soft skills or technical skills) are highly need? Can we give a
reasonable career planning guidance?

• Research Question 2 (RQ2): According to factors such as skill requirements, company locations, etc., can we build
a salary level prediction model(e.g., whether the salary can reach the average level)?


We expect this work can make the following contributions:

• We provide a machine learning model that can predict salary level in AI domain based on factors such as workers’
experience, skills, company location, etc.

• This search can provide practical guidance information such as specific skill requirements and trends in each AI
domain for professionals.
